Encircle Language Spec Plans
============================

Fundamental Principles Spec Part A | 2008-03 | Project Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------

### Introduction

This is a super-project, consisting of multiple sub-projects.

### Goal

Documented some of fundamental principles for the Encircle programming language.

Not all fundamental principles were documented in this project. Only about half of the subjects were covered. This is because a number of fundamental principles could use some clearing up on other subjects first.

That’s why the follow-up project was *Get Clearer View over Difficult Topics*.

### Super-Project

This is a sub-project of the super-project *Encircle Language Spec*.

### Date & Time

March 5, 2008 – April 13, 2008  
5 weeks and 5 days  
__66 ¾__ hours of work

### Products

The following __*16*__ articles about fundamental principles for the Encircle programming language were produced:

- *Programming Language Programmed Within Itself*

### Sub-projects

The work was split up into the following __*9*__ sub-projects:

First four articles:

1. Orient in first four articles:

    - Programming Language Programmed Within Itself
    - Generic, Not Generated
    - Small Base Code
    - Everything Only (Lack of Choice = Guarantees)

2. Document Programming Language Programmed Within Itself

3. Document Generic, No Generators

4. Finish articles Small Base Code & Everything Only (Lack of Choice = Guarantees)

Seven relatively easy articles:

5. Document Symbol = Creator

6. Document the articles:

    - Programming Language = Database
    - Data = Code

7. Document the articles:

    - Design Time = Run Time
    - User = Programmer
    - Hyperlinks = Referential Structure
    - Clear Cut Coding Principles

8. Document Internet as a Single Computer (quite difficult)

9. Document four easier articles:

   - Reflection
   - Module Integration
   - C++
   - User Interface Not Procedure Oriented
