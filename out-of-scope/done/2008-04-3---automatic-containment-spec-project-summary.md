### Goal

Fully understand automatic containment again and fully document the idea.

The super project is *Get clearer view*. In that project I was supposed to work out the ideas, that totally mess up the original way of thinking. At the beginning of the project I found out I did not understand automatic containment anymore. I decided to turn working out automatic containment into a separate project, and save the other subjects for later.

I will review old material, and brainstorm until I understand it again, document it fully, including the exact procedure of deriving containment structure out of referential structure.

Automatic Containment will be worked out in the following document:

- Automatic Containment

The following document and older versions of it might contain useful information for the project:

- Symbol = Creator

The solution to Automatic Containment was inspired by the *closest mutual parent* principle, described in the original Symbol Language documentation:

> "Symbol Language"

However hard or simple it was to solve the problem: I solved an important discrepancy between Creator and Symbol regarding one being purely referential and the other very containment based. However the simple or hard the solution: it is solved now.

The article "Automatic Containment" was produced,  
version *2008-04-24 00  1.0*
