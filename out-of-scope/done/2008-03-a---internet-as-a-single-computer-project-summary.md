### Goal

Make the article *Internet as a single computer*.  
I gathered and described a lot of ideas, but I can’t be satisfied with the article right now. But I can’t make it any better, because the ideas are too new and unclear. The article is to be revised later.  
Version *2008-04-12 XX  0.9*  was produced

### Steps

- Brainstormed
- Make a list of principles, concepts and modules that are involved
- Described the principles:
    - A unified paradigm for all digital objects
    - A single bulk of storage
    - Execution of programs running across computer boundaries
    - Security and control of concurrent use
- Uniquely identify resources on the internet:
    - Found out I can not identify each object on the internet individually
    - Research the internet protocol
    - Define how resources on the internet might be identified
- Combine all the gathered ideas and brainstorm texts
- Describe:
    - Implications for other concepts
    - Legacy modules
- Describe:
    - Mirroring
    - Site merging
    - Parallel processing
- Tried to finish up the document:
    - Read over the whole document a few times and correct
    - The article is not finished, but it is such new material, that it can’t be finished right now
    - There’s too much detail, too much fuss, too much unclarity, but this is because it is a new principle.
    - Later it might be revised, but not now.
    - I’m sure that one day it might become a crystal clear concept.
