### Parent Project

*Encircle Language Spec*

### Goal

*This document only has the notes taken out of the original document about the Encircle Language Spec review, because the topics are now out of scope of Encircle Language Spec.* 

### General Planning

Presentation:

- First say this:
    - \> [...]   
    - \> ‘Code name’ for the whole package of software is Software System.  
    and the whole package of software would be named Collection. (but those names are a secret).

- Specific things to show:
    - Project plans: __(2)__
        - Document Software System
        - Software System
    - Documentation: __(6)__
        - Software System Contents
        - Software System Introduction
            - Code
                - Automatic Containment
                - Fundamental Principles
                - Editing Concepts
            - Controls
                - Controls Concepts

- Software: __(9)__
    - \> All the files are read-only and that is going to be a problem for some of the software.
    - Creator 2.0 software
        - \> “Het ging bij Creator 2.0 niet om de perfectie. Het ging erom het zo makkelijk mogelijk werkend te krijgen.”
        -----
        - Sound 2.0
        - Math Objects XXXX-XX-XX XX
        - The code
            - The code is not perfect yet
            - How it is reprogrammed within itself
            - Do not expect it to be easy

    - Creator 0.9 software
        - Sound 0.9
        - Graphics Objects 0.9
        - Math Objects 0.9
        - The code
            - Its being based on a code generator
            - Its being concept-oriented
            - Perhaps the custom code tags
        - VB6 Generator 0.9
        - C++ Generator 0.9

### Reflection

The documentation of the Software System framework introduction was covered almost completely.
The following concepts were covered:

- Automatic Containment
