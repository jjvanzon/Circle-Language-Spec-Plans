### Introduction

Basically each element of the language specification might be given a textual representation as well.

This document tries to list some topics these ideas might entail.

### Brainstorm

Before starting this project, most coding concepts might already have been worked out.  
The diagrammatic expression of those coding concepts may also have been described.  
In this project all textual expressions might be worked out of all the coding concepts, that were already worked out.  
The 'literals' approach might be left alone for now.
