### Introduction

The *Exchangeability Principles* describe things in the area of computer technology, that may traditionally be separate, that might be combined to form one thing.

This document tries to list some topics these ideas might entail.

### Topics

- [x] Exchangeability Index Page
- [ ] Diagram & Text Code Expression
- [ ] Object Oriented = Relational
- [x] Data = Code
- [x] Programming Language = Database
- [x] Design Time = Run Time
- [x] User = Programmer
- [x] Clear Cut Coding Principles
- [ ] Attributes Are Objects
- [ ] Command = Executable Object
- [ ] Hand Signs
- [ ] Hand Writing
- [ ] Hardware & Software
- [ ] Multi-Language
- [ ] System Engineering = Software Engineering
- [ ] Internet as a Single Computer  
    - [ ] A unified paradigm for all digital objects
    - [ ] A single bulk of storage
    - [ ] Execution of programs running across machine boundaries
    - [ ] Security
    - [ ] Control of concurrent use
    - [ ] Communication between computers
    - [ ] IDâ€™s
    - [ ] Site merging
    - [ ] Parallel processing
    - [ ] Mirroring & synchronized copies
    - [ ] Implications for other concepts

#### Internet Aspects

In this phase the essential parts to make the internet function as a single computer might be completed. The following aspects might be involved:

- [ ] Internet Aspects
    - [ ] Mirroring
    - [ ] Copies
    - [ ] Internet Synchronization
    - [ ] Internet Threads
    - [ ] Publishing
    - [ ] Backup Machine
    - [ ] ... (more to come?)
- [ ] Storage \ Caching
- [ ] The Physical & The Logical
- [ ] Access Control  
    - (That might also be relevant for turning the internet into a single computer.)
