### Purpose of this Document

This document may be a raw list of the products to produce in a project. The topics mentioned here are put out of scope of the *spec* part of the *Circular-Language-Spec*. These topics might not be part of the spec (yet). They may be found under the *Construct Drafts* or *Broader View* sections of the *Circular-Language-Spec* documentation.

### Construct Drafts Topics

Drafts of ideas that might not become part of the spec. Or language constructs that are just not as clearly worked out yet.

- [ ] Expression Construct Drafts
- [ ] From Spec
    - [ ] Groups *Construct Drafts* topics that may be recognizable from the *spec*, but then maybe lesser worked out ideas about these topics.
- [ ] Implementations
- [ ] Input Output
- [ ] Text Code
- [ ] Access Control
- [ ] Ancestry Terms
- [ ] Automatic Containment
- [ ] Aspects
- [ ] Concurrency
- [ ] Conversions 
- [ ] Circular Language Spec Summary
- [ ] Errors & Warnings
- [ ] Locking
- [ ] Peels
- [ ] Special Access
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] Summaries of the C and C++ Languages
- [ ] Transactions
- [ ] Libraries

### Broader View Topics

Draft texts that might once describe a story: ideas about how this Circular language might be used in practice.

- [ ] Exchangeability (part done)
- [ ] Expression Broader View
- [ ] Extensibility (part done)
- [ ] From Spec
    - Groups *Broader View* topics that may be recognizable from the *spec*, but then ideas perhaps more philosophical and lesser to the point.
- [ ] Integration
- [ ] Semantic Modeling
- [ ] Binarals (for the purpose of compiling)
- [ ] Debugging
- [ ] Macro Recorder
- [ ] Object Storage
