- [ ] ~ Detailed.
- [ ] ~ Also raises questions here and there.
- [ ] ~ For instance the assumptions question "Where did the language lose its purity?" comes to mind in. I do see that in this chapter's text I am honest about some of these issues. It seems that later texts seem more humanized that way, what I am sort of aim to do in this project.
- [ ] ~ Base redirection for referencing by base type seems to work with both dotted and dashed lines without conflict and when it is base class redirection or interface redirection the eye might prefer one or the other. "How to detect whether it is base redirection or interface redirection by analyzing the diagram?" is a question that comes to mind, but the eye and mind seems to detect easily which is preferred. There is probably an exact definition, but might it matter? When you might program something that might use circle notation, maybe, but. And just thinking about it, it probably might fall in to place somehow.
