### Postponed

#### 2020-06-24 Postponed Content Changes for Overview Article

- [ ] ~ The descriptions of each chapter may have more detail in it, than 'required', which may make it a tougher read. I find it a bit tiring to read it, though I might tire easily. I suggest some details might be moved or left up to the actual chapter content?

### Done

#### 2020-05-31 Done Reformulating Encircle Language Spec Overview

- [x] Committing reformulations of tone of Encircle Language Spec Overview.
- [x] Maybe a 2nd phase of editing aimed at the content, not so much about the tone.
- [x] Then there is Loose Ideas at the end. Do I want to put it in a separate document? Do I want to evaluate them one by one to see if they are relevant or might be moved or something?
    - [x] Comparisons with other systems might be better off in Encircle Broader View. I feel it is interesting, that I looked around at other systems for inspiration or comparison, but it might not be that interesting to share what my opinion about it was. But topic-wise I think is might not belong in Encircle Language Spec, but in Encircle Broader View.
- [x] Images in the overview page?
    - [x] For Object Order: Not sure about the notation yet, so not sure what picture might be suitable.
    - [x] For Pointers: Current picture lies a little. This may be how you might express it with abused/abstracted notation, but this might not be a pointer in Encircle, if I look at it from a puritan perspective. It might be supposed to point 'inward'? I am not even sure.

#### 2020-05-28 Done Content Changes for Encircle Language Spec Overview

- [x] I wonder how useful it is to mention what has been programmed or not. I would like to consider what the reasons of that were and if they still apply. I think I applied that as a general rule for these 'overview' or 'index' or 'contents' documents. The Encircle Language Spec used to be part of a bigger whole that documented more pieces of software. Each contents page would mention what had been programmed and how far it was finished up. Now that the Encircle Language Spec is intended to be more isolated from the rest, this rule might not apply anymore.
- [x] Also the % state of finished up. Not sure if it necessarily adds much. Even when I say it is mostly finished, there are still loose ideas, and still adaptations I might want to make. And most topics do have some sort of description. Just some near the end are less finished up. I think I mention half-way the overview that 'now starts the ones that are less finished'.
- [x] I think maybe the conclusion should be: just remove them.
- [x] Outtake System Objects section:
    - [x] Most of the system objects are part of the *code base*.
- [x] Outtakes    Commands section:
    - [x] This seems a more general term for something you can execute on a computer.
- [x] Black Boxes
    - [x] The maybe alien nature of how black boxes took shape (the ubiquitous friend notation), might have made its story in this Overview long. But that is the design it is right now. No redesign would take place yet, is the plan. So can I shorten it? Do I admit, that maybe this notation might not be as prominent anymore at a later stage. Does it harm stability of the text if I say that? Or does it just humanize it?
    - [x] Outtake:
        - [x] The idea for the future is that *user* access control and *black boxing* access control might become a single concept of ‘what has access to what’, but that might not immediately be done at first.
- [x] Interfaces outtakes:
    - [x] Another concept, yet to be worked out, is how commands of an object are grouped by site: an object can have commands, defined on different sites, and the commands should be grouped by site in order to judge how reliable the commands are *(grouped by source)*.
    - [x] At some point the idea was, to also cover all the different *uses* of interfaces. But the different uses of interfaces are adequately described by other literature. The focus might lie on explaining the raw concept of interfaces and their presence in Encircle.
- [x] Type Control outtakes:
    - [x] Type control seems quite present in programming languages, almost as if programming languages need it. But It might be 'easier' to construct a programming language with no type control in it, than to program type control into it. You might say, that when a programming language supports classes and interfaces, then the programming language might need additional functionality. But in reality, all the possibilities are already present.
    - [x] At first there is no type control at all. Anything can reference anything and this results in all sorts of possibilities, that things might go wrong in a program. Type control only enforces restrictions. When type controls is implemented inside Encircle, it is like nothing extra is offered, but only the ability to impose more restrictions to the possiblities already offered.
- [x] Brainstorm:
    - [x] I am correcting something that does not naturally come to me somehow. I do not seem to have an intuition for it. This seems to make it harder. I am more used to evaluating whether texts are clear, not whether they are stated in a 'loose enough' fashion. I am not sure if I can do this...
    - [x] Maybe it is unnecessary. I am not sure. I would like it not to be necessary, because it does not seem I can do it.
    - [x] It seems useful, but I do not know if I can do it.
    - [x] What can do? What am I better at?
    - [x] Systemic tricks? Mark trigger words in red or something?
    - [x] Try to build up a dictionary of standard trigger words, I might usually always check for?
    - [x] I wonder whether searching on all the trigger words is useful. They seem too many. Maybe just an awareness of them is good enough to pick them out by hand.
