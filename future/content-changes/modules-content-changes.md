Encircle Language Spec Plans
============================

Module | Content Changes
------------------------

- Not sure if this might have to change. Maybe change the term 'Module' to 'Modules' instead to prevent introducing alienating terminology.

- Perhaps shed light on which constructs from other language could be represented as a module in the Encircle language, like namespaces, sites, libraries (and even protocol boundaries?).
