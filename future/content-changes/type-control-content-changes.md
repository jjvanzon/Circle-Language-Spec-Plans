- [ ] ~ It seems part of it is from the old Symbol Language.doc. It seems to attempt to demonstrate how the terms generic and explicit apply to the diagram notation. It seems to attempt to demonstrate any possible variation of it. But in doing so, it seems to explain things already explained elsewhere, but now insisting the terms generic and explicit are so centric they must be systematically demonstrated. That was a bit sarcastic, sorry, but I question if feeling the terms generic and explicit are important are reason enough to explain things twice from a different angle.
- [ ] ~ What I sort of expected to see when I opened this document, was an explanation on how type safety might be enforced in Encircle. But what I saw was the different forms of generic and explicit, that explain things I already saw in other chapters.
- [ ] ~ I think maybe I try to prove in this text too much that the idea of generic and explicit works in Encircle.
- [ ] ~ I cannot say it is bad. I am not sure where to go with this.
- [ ] ~ It almost seems to me, that pieces of these explanations could be spread among chapters Objects, Classes, Interfaces, Commands etc. Type systems seem sort of cross-cutting and centric in object oriented languages.
- [ ] ~ I once seemed to feel it was a main issue. Now I am not so sure.
- [ ] ~ I do kind of like it. I like systematic overviews. It probably is redundant information. Perhaps I can say that in an intro paragraph eventually. But for overview: I think it's nice. I think maybe I was prejudiced about it being mostly from the previous documentation Symbol Language.doc. Prejudiced about it being old. The argument that it seems redundant info I stand by, but I think it can serves a purpose.
