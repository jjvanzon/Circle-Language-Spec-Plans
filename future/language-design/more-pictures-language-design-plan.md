### 2019-08-05 Postponed More Pictures

- [ ] ~ Explaining more with images is also something I would value. That might be more intense for me, because it requires some more 'mixed' tasks, which could be more difficult for me right now: reading, determine places to put pictures, draw pictures, scan, cut them out, paste them in text.
- [ ] ~ Reading over the Interfaces planning docs I noticed I said there I like how the Interfaces chapter reads. I started reading it over. I notice, I only like how it reads where lots of little diagrams are shown. I like it not so much when I just see walls of texts. I think it is my 'brain type' so to say. But I think having both text and pictures would help a lot of brain types. So: more pictures. I like pictures.
