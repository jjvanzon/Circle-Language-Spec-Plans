#### 2020-05-24 Postponed Sequence Order Language Design

- [ ] ~ I might move that Sequence Order issue to the chapter Objects. It's single lone topic now. It starts with the word 'Object', so maybe therefore Objects is the chapter for it. It's just right now (2020-05-24) it is unfinished and unfinished things tend to be put at the bottom of the documentation right now and do not want to do anything about it right now, I think.
- [ ] ~ Automatic execution order may not be something to hide from Sequence Order. It might not seem much to describe and perhaps is just low hanging fruit.
