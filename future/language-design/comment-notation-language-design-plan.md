- [ ] ~ I am missing the notation for comment. Would be welcome. I think it is simple, unambiguous and would be a shame if it were overlooked as an option. Just a line from the text to the wherever, as long as nothing's directly connected to it, there should be nothing else that would clash with that symbolism.
