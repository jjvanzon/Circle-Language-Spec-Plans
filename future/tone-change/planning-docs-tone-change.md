### Done

#### 2020-04-13 Done Brainstorm Rewording Circle Language Spec Planning Docs

- Reformulate:
    - I might want to read over those Done projects content before publishing. I should know what I publish exactly and have evaluated it and made some adaptations possibly. Probably nothing in it is a secret, so you don't need to remove it from source control history, but slight changes might be good.
    - I did not read the content of the sub-projects or the idea box.
    - I think, I guess, I might want to go through content top-down for reformulations?
- Tone:
    - Some things especially in evaluations may seem cocky when I call my own successes very, very good. I don't know if I need to change that. I also use I and you interchangedly when I talk about myself. Not sure if I have to change that. The plans sometimes talk in definites. Maybe openness is better language, I mean more wiggle room in the wording. Not sure if that's a problem.
    - I worry what people might think of me. If they'd think I'm arrogant... maybe I should not worry about that.
    - Cockiness/speaking in definites, and scope/out-of-scope are 2 different things. My intermediate goal now was to change the tone, not to change the scope covered by the documents? There are still gray areas of scope. I think I should deal with that later?

#### 2020-04-18 Done Rewording 2008-07 02        Assignment Spec Project Summary.docx

- [x] Adding maybe's and perhapses.
- [x] Second phase reformulating > Did not change much, but did change a few things.
- [x] The word 'you' seems overly used. Try to reformulate to object-centric grammar, instead of person-centric.
- [x] Maybe read one more time for possible small typing errors.

#### 2020-04-18 Done Rewording 2008-05 02 Classes & Relationships Specs Project Summary.docx

- [x] ~~Rename "Relationship" => "Relationship" > I might keep the term relationship in there for now, otherwise I might have to go through so much documentation. If I refer to a product with the work relationship in it and change it in the planning docs, then I also might have to change it in the language spec docs and that is just a whole lot of work. I briefly looked up a discussion online about these words, and it does not seem people can find a really clear distinction or rule, just wishy washy hand wavy stuff, I think. It's just that in IT the term is usually 'relationship'. In the spirit of not alienating readers you might change it, but it does not seem semantically incorrect might you accidentally use the word 'relationship' instead.~~

#### 2020-04-18 Done Rewording 2008-06 02 Command as an Aspect Spec Project Summary.docx

- [x] It mentions topics very much out of scope.
- [x] I think it might not be harmful to keep that mentioning in there.
- [x] Maybe I am trying to hide the out-of-scope topics too rigorously.
- [x] There seem to be maybe's and perhapses missing, but it does not seem to sound too blunt.
- [x] Reconsider to split into in-scope and out-of-scope parts.
- [x] Brainstorm: The input / output topics is so present in this sub-project description. It does not seem lightly touching the topic. Sometimes it is half a paragraph that goes on about just that, while it is not in-scope anymore. Maybe it is worth trying to extract it out, so the summaries of the work become simpler.

#### 2020-04-18 Done Rewording 2008-06 03        Clarify Command as an Aspect Spec Project Summary.docx

- [x] I might like to look at the end-result of the project 'Clarify Command as an Aspect Spec' to see if the description of the work done still makes sense if you split it in two.
- [x] Maybe the sub-project Clarify Command as an Aspect is mostly out-of-scope.
- [x] That whole project should be out of scope, because the end-result is just about input/output and concurrency resolution.
- [x] That might change the super project description too.

#### 2020-04-18 Done Rewording 2008-07 01        System Objects Spec Project Summary.docx

- [x] Maybe reformulate harsher words, rather than understanding the text of all the notes. The notes are really unpolished.
- [x] > Was at 'Other Issues' taking out the more harsh wordings.
- [x] I see the difficulty of using the words 'concept' vs. 'aspect'. I want to call it 'aspects' everywhere. But contradictory: 'aspects' is now considered out of scope, while I cannot easily prevent mentioning it at all, because it was in the back of my head during some of these projects. I also have this a little with the term 'code base' which I want to rename to 'base of the code', because 'code base' is a term often used differently in IT.
- [x] Out of scope ideas:
    - [x] I see this document talks about what I might rather call a runtime. Figuring out how Encircle could work stand-alone up and running is probably not in the scope of this project anymore. Just describing the language, mostly the diagram notation, is.
    - [x] I see a sentence where I call the System Objects essential for the workings of Encircle. But if you see the notation as separate from the runtime it does not seem that essential.
    - [x] So how do I reword this putting these ideas out of scope, without harming the integrity of the content?
    - [x] Hyp: In the original text I express that I feel system objects are essential, as a run-time, not for the notation.
    - [x] I keep seeing the idea of a runtime back. It's an interesting idea, but not in the anymore scope as I want to isolate it. I am reluctant to remove the text, because it is so nicely descriptive about that idea.
    - [x] All in all, I am still uneasy about multiple subjects now considered out of scope, being intermixed in the texts of this sub-project description.
    - [x] The 'other issues' seems to contain loose ideas not fully worked out, part of the aspects construct for instance, or about a run-time. It seems to me some of those ideas, e.g. under 'Other Issues' could be cut-pasted to out-of-scope Encircle Language projects.
    - [x] It seems the System Objects Spec Project Summary has a some content that is maybe lazily left in there, while they are also like future ideas?
    - [x] Q: The things that I now consider out of scope, that are mentioned in the sub-project planning documentation for System Objects, are those things even inside the actual language spec content for System Objects? Or is the language spec content also littered with now consider out of scope content?
    - [x] I read most of the content of the System Objects chapter. I forgot what for. To assess whether the topics in the planning docs about it even made it into the documentation. Maybe I can assess that later.
    - [x] Read the sub-project documentation again, to see if some things can be moved out-of-scope?
    - [x] As I read the first sentences of the sub-project planning doc, I tend to want to redescribe it, now I can put it into context. As I explain that context, the integrity of the planning doc seems in tact again.
    - [x] I want to keep reading over and reformulating.

#### 2020-04-18 Done Rewording The Done Encircle Language Spec Planning Docs

- [x] Ideas document: ISNSE = Internet as a Single Computer > But why? Internet aS a[N] Single Entity?
- [x] Brainstorm: Scope the Done projects?
    - [x] I was already putting things out of scope, not just reformulating. I have done that for the Future projects, because putting it out of scope was easier than reformulating some of the difficult text. Maybe that rule does not hold up for reformulating the Done projects. I want to realize that the focus is on reformulation, not scoping. Only if it helps me get through the reformulations, I may want to also fine-tune the scoping in the planning docs.
    - [x] So the same argument kind of applies. If I know it is out of scope, I can just move it without further reformulation.
    - [x] Fortunately I am quite clear on what I put out of scope.
    - [x] Q: Might all 'fundamental principles' be put out of scope?
    - [x] Exp: Read some of the actual documentation.
    - [x] A: Yes, 'fundamental principles' is out of scope with the current ideas I have now.
    - [x] By the way: I saw '2. Concurrency' under '3. Operating System' in the Encircle Docs. I couldn't find that content before. Found it.
- [x] I tend to want to subdivide all the Done projects into groups, like I did the Future projects. (in the Other folder, not Encircle Language Spec).
    - [x] But I get cramps in my face.
    - [x] It's hard, because it means processing many disparate pieces of information, which takes too much energy/strain for me.
    - [x] Feels bad to leave a grouping/categorization half- finished.
    - [x] Can I make this easier for myself? Dim the screen. Dark mode might have been nice, but don't have it on Windows 7. Take it slower. Worry less about (small) mistakes. Accept this might take a while. Forget about everything else?
- [x] Done projects (now out of scope)
    - [x] ~~2008-03 02        Fundamental Principles Spec Part A Project Summary.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~2008-03 03             Orient in First Four Fundamental Principles Project Summary.docx~~
    - [x] ~~2008-03 04             Computer Language Programmed Within Itself Spec Project Summary.docx~~
    - [x] ~~2008-03 05             Generic, No Generators Spec, Project Summary.docx~~
    - [x] ~~2008-04 02        Get Clearer View over Difficult Topics Project Summary.docx~~

#### 2020-04-18 Done Encircle Language Spec Planning Docs: Rewording Main Project and Future Sub-Projects

- [x] The aim is to use less definite, more open, language and to take out the personal 'I' form.
- [x] I think a lot of documents do not contain as much prose as Encircle Language Spec Strategy, so maybe things are doable after all. Also it does not drain my energy much. It is relaxing work to me. So I am not sure how much it matters, how long it takes.
- [x] ~~Limitation: I choose to not reorganize/resubdivide the sub projects. I choose to just change the wording.~~
- [x] Main Project
    - [x] Mostly finished rewriting the content.
- [x] Future Sub-Projects
    - [x] Assignment Spec Update Ideas.md
    - [x] ~~Automatic Containment Spec Plan.docx~~
        - [x] ~~Split up topics about Diagram Metrics from Automatic Containment: two topics. Those intertwine in those two documents.~~
        - [x] ~~Automatic Containment was going to be put out of scope, because it is so difficult and really in the way of explaining how to use these diagrams normally.~~
        - [x] ~~I said I might focus on reformulating, not on scoping, but I just don't want to reformulate this content, it is so unclear.~~
        - [x] ~~Might I simply move more to the 'out-of-scope' document? I doubt, because I moved 'Errors' and the 'Aspect Construct' from out-of-scope to in-scope but postponed, because they 'felt' part of the language. Now the scoping rules change and I am wondering about how to organize things for a moment.~~
        - [x] ~~Looking at the folder subdivision of the planning docs, it does seem like it should be moved there. And so does the aspect construct. Moved back again.~~
    - [x] Classes Spec Update Ideas.md
    - [x] Commands Spec Update Ideas.md
    - [x] Aspect Construct Spec Project Summary.docx
        - [x] Move out-of-scope.
    - [x] Aspects as External Modules Spec Goal (2008-05) (postponed).docx
        - [x] Move out-of-scope.
    - [x] Concurrency Resolution Spec Project Summary.docx
        - [x] Move out-of-scope.
        - [x] 'Advanced Input/Output' is Concurrency Resolution?
        - [x] There is overlap, but I'm not sure. If I read over the product list, I think I'd have to look into it deeper to determine if all of that Input/Output stuff is up for postponement. 
        - [x] I have looked at multiple sources of information, but cannot determine yet if the topics mentioned under the Input Output section of the Products List are in scope or out of scope, due to the concurrency resolution's being in-scope and out-of-scope.
        - [x] ~~I feel part of the TODO products are already done.~~
        - [x] ~~I feel 'normal' parameter topic are intermixed with concurrency resolution / automatic execution order too much?~~
        - [x] Or is it to shed new light on these topics in the area of automatic execution order?
        - [x] ~~Alternative: Split apart in two: The parts / product list items, that I know are about concurrency resolution / automatic execution order might be put out of scope and then parts I am not sure about, might stay in in-scope with some comment shedding light on that doubt.~~
        - [x] Exp: Read over a product list in the Future Sub-Project document "Input Output Spec Project Summary.docx".
        - [x] Hyp: All the topics under Input / Output inside the main "Encircle Language Spec Product List.docx" are not trivial parameter topics, but more a small ramp of parameter topics leading towards the automatic execution order concept.
        - [x] ~~Hyp: But the Integration of Parameter Input/Output Concepts do seem already done topics.~~
        - [x] Hyp: But may fall under the same umbrella: now put into the light of automatic execution order.
        - [x] Parameters and input/output concepts entangle. The proposed product list might aim to disentangle those topics and explain their precise relationship.
        - [x] I had a brainstorm. I put that in the Future Sub-Project doc in the out of scope folder.
    - [x] Diagram Metrics Ideas.md
    - [x] Diagrams, Coding Principles & Coding Aspects Plan (old).docx
        - [x] At first glance, this seems to have the same scope as the whole project Encircle Language Spec.
        - [x] Maybe it can be thrown away (or archived), because it's already described by newer documents.
    - [x] `Execution Control Spec Update Ideas.md`
    - [x] `Module Spec Update Ideas.md`
    - [x] `Objects Multiplicity Spec Ideas.md`
    - [x] `Objects Spec Update Idea.md`
    - [x] `Parameters Spec Update Ideas.md`
    - [x] `Relationships Spec Update Ideas.md`
    - [x] `Static Spec Idea.md`
        - [x] The second half is an idea, that is explanatory on some of my ideas about static. But also it uses a concept I want to put out of scope: Code = Data. I want to save such concepts for 'Encircle Language JJ's Construct Proposals' or something.
        - [x] I might not want to remove it, if I look at that it explains how I see 'static' in a broader view.
        - [x] But to understand my own doubts about the different ways to see the concept of 'static' that idea description explains a lot and otherwise I might think: where did that idea go and how does it work?
        - [x] I feel that this concept of static might have a place in the general descriptions, but to apply this to the concept of Code = Data, though interesting to me, might not have to be part of that, because it may confuse and alienate the reader, who might be more familiar with more regular implementations of the concept.
    - [x] `System Objects Spec Update Ideas.md`
    - [x] Text Code Spec Project Summary.docx
        - [x] Out of scope
        - [x] But change the main project description too.

#### 2020-04-18 Done Encircle Language Spec Planning Docs: Format the Project Summaries

- [x] Change formatting in bulk (of Done Projects / Project Summaries)
    - [x] Change fonts and layout in bulk first.
        - [x] All normal text Calibri 11.
        - [x] Heading 2:
            - [x] Use heading 2 for e.g. 'Goal' and 'Date & Time'.
            - [x] Heading 2 Calibri 10 bold, 9pt before, 9pt after
            - [x] Instead of 'Dates' say 'Date & Time'
            - [x] Americanish heading case usage
        - [x] Sub-title:
            - [x] Author and location Calibri 10, italic, 0.5 cm indented
            - [x] No 'date' subtitle, since it is implied by the content of heading 1
            - [x] Make spacing uniform.
        - [x] Indent of normal text is not consistent among documents.
        - [x] Heading 1:
            - [x] Heading 1 month in separate line
            - [x] Heading 1 no comma's at the end of the lines
            - [x] Shorter heading 1
            - [x] Heading 1 Calibri
        - [x] Maybe double-check the formatting afterwards by opening all documents on top of each other, closing them one by one, to see if all is uniform.
        - [x] Forgot the Done projects that have their own folder.
            - [x] > They use different templates, so this formatting and making consisntent, probably does not apply to those.
        - [x] Don't Future Sub-Projects also have documents in that 'project summary' format?
            - [x] Alternative: format those too.
            - [x] Alternative: Go look for more project summaries in the Encircle Language Spec Plan folders.
            - [x] ~~Alternative: Don't do it.~~

#### 2020-04-13 Done Encircle Language Spec Planning Docs

- [x] I made a slight beginning with a next phase of scoping the project. But I want to turn back. 
- [x] Check if I can check this in.
- [x] Do reformulations while maintaining the current scoping.
- [x] This is a lot of work. I am not even sure if I can do it.
- [x] It being forbidden to use the word 'I' and to be afraid to come off cocky... those are very strict rules to set for myself. Maybe too strict. I have trouble with this. Time may be better spent on something else.
- [x] It's weird that if you want to make a project public property, it is strange to have the word 'I' in a project definition. In notes, maybe, but in central project definition it may be weird... But changing this just conflicts with my lack of energy.
- [x] In my efforts to speak in a non-personal tense, I sometimes switch to the 'you' form and then it just sounds like I can't even keep the terms 'I' and 'you' apart... maybe I am over-conscientious and insecure here. 'You' is fine if you explain how one might experience something.
- [x] I read some articles over personal and impersonal forms of language like that.

#### 2020-01-30 Done Reformulating Planning Docs

I read over Encircle Language Spec Strategy.doc and reformulated stuff.
I am cleaning up Encircle Language Spec Products.doc: simplified color coding, removed mentioning 'in a Diagram' and 'in Text Code' article variations. I might remove detail from done work, but keep it in the proposed work. May remove some 'musts' by 'mays'. Might add intro docs to calm the reader's nerves down, on the overwhelming amount of topics. Do I need to excuse myself for introducing topic names, without actually describing what it entails? Don't know. That description might *be* the product. I have a conundrum. I cannot describe the product without making the product, because the description is the product.
