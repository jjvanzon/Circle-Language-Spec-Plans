### Super-Project

Encircle Language Spec

### Goal

Document the implementation of *commands as an aspect*, and a chapter about parameters.

Rather than a single topic, *commands as an aspect* is considered a group of topics surrounding commands (also called methods, procedures or functions.)

The project proved to be quite some work, so it was split up into sub-projects.

### Date & Time

July 14, 2008 – October 1, 2008  
2 ½ months  
235 hours of work

### Sub-Projects

The work was split up into the following sub-projects:

- *Document System Objects Articles*
- *Document Assignment Articles*
- *Document Commands Articles*
- *Organize Encircle Language Ideas (1)*
- *Document Parameters Articles*

(The sub-project *Clarify Command as an Aspect Spec* used to be part of this super-project, but was later moved out of scope.)
