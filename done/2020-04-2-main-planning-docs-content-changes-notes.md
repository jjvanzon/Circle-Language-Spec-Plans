### 2020-04-15 Done Encircle Language Spec Planning Docs

- [x] I finished 'Encircle Language Spec Strategy'.
- [x] 'Encircle Language Spec Product List' seems finished.
- [x] The word 'Legacy' is in there, which I tried to avoid.
    - [x] Integration was not the best word, it seemed.
    - [x] 'Inherited' is too ambiguous a term.
    - [x] It is because other languages have those concepts?
    - [x] Oh, wait, it is my own subdivision.
    - [x] Maybe the word Legacy is ok there, because there is only the danger of putting down my own work, not others'.
    - [x] It seems like it could be both.
    - [x] 'Existing' is a little ambiguous too.
    - [x] Why was integrate such a bad word according to my brother?
    - [x] Synonyms?
    - [x] I am going for 'integrate'.
- [x] 'Encircle Language Spec Steps & Time Planning' should be next.
    - [x] Yeah, has definite language, that might need more wiggle room.
    - [x] Sometimes I don't even notice it, because I am so used to try and gain a sense of control over the situation, that I just speak in definites.
    - [x] Resolute language is solved.
    - [x] 'Overview for Progress Monitoring' is not the same list as the scored and prioritized work items above it.
    - [x] Why is there even a separate list for 'Progress Monitoring'? It seems handy for quick overview, but why is the main list not quickly giving that overview then? Improve the main list instead and remove the 'Overview for Progress Monitoring'? Because it might just not be handy to have two things.
    - [x] Inheritance is already finished.
        - [x] Do I update that now? Or do I see that as replanning that should be done later? Don't know. It just looks inconsistent this way.
- [x] Done Encircle Language Spec Ideas.
    - [x] The wording is in rougher format, but it is not very long, so should be doable.
    - [x] It may have out-of-scope content.
    - [x] Maybe read over again. Second time around it still seems kind of resolute.
