Encircle Language Spec Plan | Commands Spec | 2008-08 | Project Summary
=====================================================================


Super-Project
-------------

*Encircle Language Spec | Command as a Concept Spec*


Goal
----

Working out the basic command topics.  
Not going deeply into parameters.  
Advanced command topics can be left out.

One of the main issues worked out in this project would be commands being 'as free' as an object.


Date & Time
-----------

June 28, 2008 – August 31, 2008  
1 month and 3 days  
__120__ hours of work


Means
-----

Something challenging was to come up with the creation behavior of calls.  
Several times the article list changed.  
At one point a change in style was to try and isolate rules into separate articles, instead of repeated in multiple places.  
That helped shape the content.  
In the end it seemed more work than initially thought.


Products
--------

At the beginning of the project, the amount of articles to produce or adapt was __43__.  
Eventually the amount of articles produced or adapted was __110__.  

The following was produced:  

- __106__ articles were produced
- __4__ articles were adapted
