### Super-Project

*Circular Language Spec*

### Character of the Work

Organizing things

### Goal

Scattering around the content from the original *Symbol Language* documentation over the articles of the *Circular Language* documentation in its newer form.

The original *Symbol Language* documentation was last worked on in 2004 and was of 367 pages of content.

Each piece of text in the original *Symbol Language* documentation was placed into the development version of an article inside the newer documentation.

### Date & Time

October 3, 2008 – October 13, 2008  
__11__ days  
__16__ hours of work

### Project Notes

- By placing an idea in an appropriate article, the content is at least in a logical place, even though it might make the article seem less 'finished up'.
- It might not be easy to change all those ideas to a more 'finished up' state, but the work to do that might be split up in more than one project.
- \> Similar things were done in a project ‘Rethink Software System’ between October 2007 and February 2008. There it was done for for the 'Creator' documentation then and for loose 'Ideas' in general.  
In this project it is done for the Symbol documentation.  
Back then the function in mind for the Symbol documentation was that it could serve a a 'cross out list' while writing newer documentation.  
But now it might be used to scatter its content around the newer documentation.  
- Looked for more cross out documents, for instance the Relational Structure document.
Considered processing them too.
    - \> The following were found:
        - Core Cross Out
        - Storage Cross Out
        - Threads Cross Out
        - Relation Structure Cross Out
    - But the option was chosen, to not process those right away.
