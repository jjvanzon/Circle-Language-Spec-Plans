Encircle Language Spec Plans
============================

Part B | Evaluation
-------------------

*May, 2010*

Making the new computer language has been an ongoing project, since the end of the year 2000.

In June 2009 the strategy was renewed and included:

- Making a planning for the period to come.
- Making it theoretically possible, if anyone wanted to, to pick up the idea from that point on.

The strategy can still be found as version *2010-05-14 00* of the parent project *Encircle Language Spec*.

Part of the strategy was: making it theoretically possible for others to pick up the idea. This goal was mostly already realized before this phase. A review together with my brother indicated that the ideas seemed worked out enough for others to be theoretically able to pick up the work from that point on, if anyone should want to. The project before this period had probably made that possible. In that project just about every part of the system was given a definition as part of a 'contents page' or 'index page' for each folder with content. These descriptions seemed to make the material easier to pick up. So the main goal for the most part seemed already reached.

I am doing *Encircle Language Spec* projects, because I think maybe I should never stop doing that entirely.

I have finished two topics of the new computer language and I did it fast in my view. I used to have ideas about what topics I wanted to describe, but I have different ideas about that now. The design is getting close to a useable specification of a programming language, so I should look further than just to preserve my thoughts.

The strategy is about to change. The main strategy: making it possible for others to pick up my work, does not count anymore, because most of that is realized. I will work on the new computer language. But I have different ideas about which parts of it I want to realize, and I might start working towards an implementation of the software, instead of designing it on paper only. I might want to start thinking about what is required to make it this a fully useable product.

I will describe the past period here. I will sum up the work that has been done, as an overview of this period and then I will start a new period, with new goals.
