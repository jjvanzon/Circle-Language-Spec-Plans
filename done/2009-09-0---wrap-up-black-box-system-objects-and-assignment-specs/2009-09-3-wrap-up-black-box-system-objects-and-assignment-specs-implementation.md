Purpose of This Document
------------------------

This document is a checklist for software development-related work, for a good approach and to not forget anything. It is not to be read over literally. Later it serves as a reference for looking up how exactly something was done.


Approach
--------

The original idea was to first read over all the material, and then decide what to change about it.  
But eventually the changes were made while reading it over. That seemed faster to do, and it was.
