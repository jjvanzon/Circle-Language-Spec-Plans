### Purpose of This Document

This document is a checklist for software development-related work, for a good approach and to not forget anything. It is not to be read over literally. Later it serves as a reference for looking up how exactly something was done.

### Orientation Checklist

- [x] Create a new project out of it and start planning.
- [x] Do not hold on too much to original step plannings and project-related brainstorms. Make an entirely new plan.
-----
- [x] Setup project folders
- [x] Estimate how long you might be working on the orientation phase.
    - [x] \> Not long. Analyzing existing material might be long, but that might be moved to the research phase.
- [x] Determine goal 
    - [x] Describe goal
    - [x] Also fill in the other headings in *Software Development Goal* document.
- [x] Determine program elements (in the document *Software Development Elements & Time Estimation*)

- [x] Intermediate planning:

    - [x] Now you can say how much time the *research phase* is going to cost.
        - [x] \> A little more than usual, because existing material is read over in its entirety and a plan might be based on the research.
    - [x] You can also give a rough estimation of the time-cost of the *whole project* based on the program elements.
        - [x] I *am* going to do full score point estimation, even though I have not analyzed all the existing material in detail.
    - [x] Make a rough time estimation, based on the elements of the project (in the document *Software Development Elements & Time Estimation*).  
    You can really only make a good estimation of the time-cost after the research phase, but the research phase may take too long to deliver a time-cost estimation only after that.

- [x] The initial planning is made, but the plan might already be changed. Some things might be postponed indefinitely.

- [x] The current goal description and planning might be isolated into a version, and then the low-priority stuff might be left out of the planning.

- [x] Make the second (initial) plan. Isolate a version of that. You are going to adapt the plan again during the research phase.

- [x] Brainstorm about solutions
