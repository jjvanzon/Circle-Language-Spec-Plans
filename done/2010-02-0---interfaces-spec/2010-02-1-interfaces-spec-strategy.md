### Parent Project

*Encircle Language Spec*

### Goal

The goal of this project is to work out the *Interfaces* articles.

### Means

There is a ton of existing material that needs to be put in a better form.  
The idea box also needs to be processed.

### Character of the Work

Working out a chapter of documentation, based on existing brainstorm texts.

### Big Issue

Reliability of interfaces in case of bidirectional relations was the biggest open issue.

### Strategy

Part of the strategy was not to organize all the existing material, but to create a topic list out of it and start over. In the end the existing material was used as a cross-out list.

Because the interfaces concept needs to catch up with the rest of the documentation, pretty much all the basic concepts may need to be covered again for interfaces.

First work out the easy issues and save the harder topics for later. The main topics might probably not change anyway and at least you might have worked those out then, and by the time you get to the harder topics, the penny might have dropped already.

### Approach

I might follow the rules set in the parent project descriptions. Especially consider the *Writing Efficiently* rules in the *Strategy* document of the *Encircle Language Spec* project.

### Limitations

You have to limit the time you spend at it, because your studies may go first.  
You have to make dues with the fact that you are not on a schedule regarding this project.  
Do not go into Black Boxes applied to Interfaces.

### Time Planning

No tight time planning might be maintained.

### Future

You should not plan to do yet another *Encircle Language Spec* project. Do not plan this ahead too much. You should focus on your studies. But I may keep it as a hobby if I put your studies first.
