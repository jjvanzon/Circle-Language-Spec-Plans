Encircle Language Spec Plans
============================

Interfaces Spec | 2010-02 | Evaluation
--------------------------------------

### Introduction

This evaluation will be kept very limited.

### General Evaluation

To create a topic list, start over and cross-out worked quite well. It seemed to take  less energy, less time time, less frustration and it may have created a fresher new story.  
It just worked quite well not to hold on too tight to an existing structure when the existing structure seems questionable.

The next project for *Encircle Language Spec* might be *Work Out Static, Redo Relations & Classes*. This because *Encircle* seems quite dynamic, and *Static* might be the thing for a class to make any definition something constant. I think I gained some insight into the concept now and I feel I might be ready to work it out. As I do that, I might also change the *Classes & Relations* documentation. They need a redo in my view and the concept of classes seems very much involved so perhaps just do that.

Starting with easier stuff and saving the harder stuff for last or when the solution comes to you also seems an energy saver and feels more relaxed.

### Eventual Time Cost

About __35__ hours.

A little in February 2010, most of it end April 2010, beginning of May 2010.

### Reflection On Approach

I feel I was quite practical and strategic perhaps.

### Reflection On Functionality

I quite like the chapter. I feel it might be nice to read.
