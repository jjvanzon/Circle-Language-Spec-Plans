### Done

#### 2019-08-05 Done New Intro

- [x] Maybe an introduction might do. The 'older' versions actually seemed to give that more gradual intro, that takes the reader by the hand, leading them to how and why this might actually be useful, rather than just plainly stating the shapes that the diagrams can contain.
- [x] That said, I do want to quickly come to the raw definition of how the diagrams are built-up. To introduce the raw basic specs quickly.

#### 2020-05-28 Done New Intro

- [x] I have the idea, that I might copy and paste more content and search and replace certain basic trigger words like 'is' by 'could' and 'might' for instance. And also visually scan the text for trigger words, like superlatives, words that see express value or devalue.
- [x] I might like to replace the word 'Procedure' by 'Command', also in the pictures.
- [x] When I change notations, the call lines in the Encircle Language Spec Introduction might become dashed.

#### 2020-05-28 Done Brainstorm New Intro: Word Stress

I started writing over sentences from the 'old' Symbol Language documentation. I kept finding words that might seem opinionated. I feel things are slow. I liked the older text, except for some parts. Now it is like I want to reconsider each word from it, and replace it by something milder. But it seems so difficult to be so wary.

So I have the idea, that I might copy and paste more content and search and replace certain basic trigger words like 'is' by 'could' and 'might' for instance. And also visually scan the text for trigger words, like superlatives, words that see express value or devalue.

Copying text, then adapting it to be more gentle, might also not be easy. I might read over things quickly and not notice things. But carefully reconsidering each word, feels a bit cramped. It also feels less appreciative of the previous text, which I thought I liked.

It just feels I am taking these communication style rules a bit too far.

I feel that if I am not over-alert about the written text, I feel I might not recognize that a statement could be too black and white or opinionated, or an exaggerated view. So I seem to be inducing an alertness that I cannot maintain. Also I question how necessary all of this strain is. I just don't really know.
