### Remark

This is the initial plan. The plan changed during the project. You might find the changed plan in a different document. But the initial plan still matters for overview of the project.

### Parent Project

*Circular Language Spec*

(Most objectives are explained inside the documentation of the parent project.)

### Character of the Work

Documentation / functional design

### Goal

- Plan complete remains of *Circular Language Spec*
- Functionally work out the *Black Box* concept.

### Side-goals

- Process Idea Box

### Limitations

- Do not update project plan templates. Make dues with the way they are now.
- When processing the idea box, the first 29 ½ pages are old ideas. Do not look at them.

### Approach

This is the approach for working out the *Black Box* concept.  
Look over the existing material there is now.  
Work out the idea as you go along.  
Make concise documentation.  
Consider the ‘writing efficiently’ rules in the project documentation of *Circular Language Spec*.

### Benefits

This is one of the easiest topics left. The benefits of working out an easy topic is that the easy topics are most overdue, fastest to make, and because they are clear in your head they might also be clearer on paper, so it might produce better quality of documentation.

### Future

After this project it is probably best to work on Microsoft certification first.  
The following 8 months are planned ahead, so it is clear what is next for the future.  
See parent project *Circular Language Spec*.

### Conditions

You might orient yourself into the idea box and the existing documentation in order to really know the extent of the work and to really go into details about the approach.

### Time Planning

A rough time planning of this 8 month period can be found in the project documentation of the super-project *Circular Language Spec*.

This sub-project might have a small time-planning document.

It is estimated, that this project may take only __1 week__ or __10 days__ tops.

### Particular Difficulty

A difficult part of this project is working your way through a lot of existing ideas: the idea box is 60 pages, and the ideas in the unfinished Black Box documentation are 29 pages of loose ideas yet to be turned into good documentation. Most of that is out of the original Symbol documentation (the unfinished design of a diagram notation for program code from the year 2004). But it might probably serve only as a cross-out list. So they might not be carefully considered in advance.
