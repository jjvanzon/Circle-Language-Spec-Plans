Encircle Language Spec Plans
============================

Planning + Black Box Spec Part A | 2009-06 | Eventual Plan | Strategy
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Remark

This is the eventual plan. The plan changed during the project. The initial plan can still be found in a different document.

### Parent Project

*New Computer Language Functional Design*

(Most objectives are explained inside the documentation of the parent project.)

### Character of the Work

Documentation / functional design

### Goal

- Plan complete remains of *New Computer Language Functional Design*.
- Functionally work out the *Black Box* concept.

### Side-Goals

- Process *Idea Box*
- Redo the *System Objects* chapter
- Redo the *Assignment* chapter
  
### Limitations

- Do not update project plan templates. Make dues with the way they are now.
- When processing the idea box, the first 29 ½ pages are older ideas. Do not look at them.

### Approach

This is the approach for working out the *Black Box* concept.  
Look over the existing material there is now.  
Work out the idea as you go along.  
Make concise documentation.  

Consider the ‘writing efficiently’ rules in the project documentation of *New Computer Language Functional Design*.

### Benefits

This was supposed to be one of the easiest topics left. The benefits of working out an easy topic is that the easy topics are most overdue, fastest to make, and because they are clear in your head they will also be clearer on paper, so it will produce better quality of documentation.

### Conditions

You have to orient yourself into the idea box and the existing documentation in order to really know the extent of the work and to really go into details about the approach.

### Particular Difficulties

A difficult part of this project is working your way through a lot of existing ideas: the idea box was 60 pages, and the ideas in the unfinished Black Box documentation were 29 pages of loose ideas. Most of that is out of the original Symbol documentation (the unfinished design of a diagram notation for program code from the year 2004). They do not all have to be carefully considered in advance. A lot of it will serve as a cross-out list. 

The amount of work was underestimated, but this could not have been foreseen.

Since *Black Boxing* is based on *System Objects* and *Assignment*, those two themes needed to be adapted to match with the new *Black Boxing* concept. This resulted in basically redoing *System Objects* and *Assignment*. This was a lot of work.

The extra work was not properly planned. Due to this scope-creep, after a while it was decided to discontinue the current project and define the remaining work as a new project, so that a new proper planning could be applied to it again.

### Future

First the new project will be done, in which Black Boxing, System Objects and Assignment are adequately finished up.  
After that there will be worked on Microsoft certification first.  
The parent project *New Computer Language Functional Design* explains clearly what to furtherly do next for the future.

### Time Planning

A rough time planning of this 8 month period can be found in the project documentation of the super-project *New Computer Language Functional Design*.

It was estimated in advance, that this project may take only __1 week__ or __10 days__ tops.  
But when the scope of the problem area became clear, it turned out to be a lot more work and along with other problems, __2 ½ months__ went by.

__Total: 123 ½ hours__
