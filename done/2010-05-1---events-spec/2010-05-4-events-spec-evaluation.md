### Evaluation

The time expenditure was quite low: 18 hours.  
The articles look quite good. It is complete and it just makes sense.  
The strategy was good: do the most easy topic, use existing material as inspiration for a topic list, start over and later use existing material as a cross-out list.

The hard part was the obsessiveness and trying to get enough sleep at night.  
Apart from that I can not think of anything that went wrong.

What might have helped is that the picture of the rest of the language is getting clearer.

Try to have the same strategy in the next project, if it works there, but be open to other approaches if the situation requires a different one.

### Future

What might happen now is that I might make a new parent project description, basically replanning all my software development activities for the time to come.

These activities might include updating document templates, studying and doing *Encircle Language Spec* projects.
