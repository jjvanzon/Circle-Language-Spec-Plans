### Background

I had an idea about the basic diagram notation for Events since 2002, but an idea about an acceptable notation for drawing out a multicast event popped into my head now in 2010. Then after having studied and updated document templates for 6 ½ hours, I decided to reward myself with doing another *Circular Language* project: *Events*.

### Parent Project

*Circular Language Spec*

### Character of the Work

Working out a chapter of documentation.

### Goal

The goal of this project is to work out the *Events* articles.

### Strategy

The strategy mostly was: *improvise*.

But lessons learned from the previous project were kept in mind:

- Pick the easiest topic
- Make a topic list out of existing rough texts, starting over,  
and then using the existing text as a cross out

### Before

Before the project the material was quite limited:

- there were just a couple of pages of loose ideas,
- loose texts coming out of a ± 2005 design of the code generator version,
- loose material coming out of a ± 2003 design of the diagram notation.

### After

After the project the *Events* concept was fully worked out including the diagram notation.

### Time Planning

No particular time planning was used.
