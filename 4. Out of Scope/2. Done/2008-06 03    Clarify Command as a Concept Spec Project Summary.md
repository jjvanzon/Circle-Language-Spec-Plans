Circle Language Spec Plan | Clarify Command as a Concept Spec | 2008-06 | Project Summary
=========================================================================================


Goal
----

Clarify everything unclear about:

- Automatic execution order
- Parameters, input, output, throughput 
- The implementation of commands as a concept

And their diagram expression.

To which extent this can solve concurrency issues was also looked at but not fully worked out.


Super-Project
-------------

This project used to be the beginning of the project ‘Command As A Concept’, which proved to be too large, so it was split up into multiple projects.


Date & Time
-----------

June 23, 2008 – July 13, 2008  
__3__ weeks  
__52 ¼__ hours of work


Products
--------

A document was produced: *Command As A Concept Brainstorm Texts*  
It is put in the documentation as the *Commands*  article group version *2008-07-13 XX .*  
It is approximately __32__ pages of brainstorm texts trying to clarify commands as a concept.


Project Steps
-------------

- [x] Go through all ideas you can find
- [x] Organize brainstorm items
- [x] Reformulate brainstorm texts, determining how things will be
    - [x] In, out, thru, down
        - [x] Reconsider
        - [x] Integrate old text into new text
        - [x] Reformulate the introduction
        - [x] Reformulate the Parameter Passing Type Details
        - [x] Make the parameter passing specific sections a more complete description, taking over texts from he introduction.
        - [x] Reformulate the Issues sections
    - [x] Automatic Execution Order
        - [x] Reformulate
        - [x] Cross out remaining brainstorms
        - [x] Regroup information
    - [x] Postpone concurrency resolution  
        - [x] Make it a future project
    - [x] System interface
    - [x] Remaining topics
- [x] Read over some material:
    - [x] Read over the execution control articles  
          \> Was not that influential anymore.
    - [x] Read over brainstorm texts.
- [x] Revise the list of articles
- [x] Version the brainstorm texts, before cutting it up.
- [x] Change order of documentation:
    - [x] More into the order in which you might like to read it.
    - [x] You might have the tendency to jump around the documentation, if something in the flow is off. So a change of the order might help there.
    - [x] Drop Diagram and Text expression right next to conceptual explanation
    - [x] Mix Coding Principles and Concepts
        - [x] I often change my mind about implementing something as a 'principle' or as a 'concept'. (The difference between concept and principle is 'made up' just to label things: a principle would be an intrinsic part of the language, a concept could be programmed out using the language itself.)
        - [x] It seems less ideal to have some assignment topics on one end of the documentation, and other assignment topics at the other end of the documentation.
    - [x] Add ‘Implementation’ section to each concept.
    - [x] Change the documentation titles  
          (articles have moved to another documentation section)
    - [x] Group together Concept and Diagram versions.
        - [x] Per concept
        - [x] For groups of concepts
    - [x] Try to make the file names nice again.
    - [x] Better numbering of articles.
    - [x] ~ Summary of what the small base of the code will consist of / which coding 'concepts' are 'principles'.
    - [x] Flat & Structure Interchange seem spread around the documentation too.
        - [x] But a summary was put in Fundamental Principles
    - [x] It may be useful to have some extra diagram expression topics:
        - [x] Basic diagram elements
        - [x] Diagrams as a concept
        - [x] Automatic containment (is also a diagram expression topic.)
