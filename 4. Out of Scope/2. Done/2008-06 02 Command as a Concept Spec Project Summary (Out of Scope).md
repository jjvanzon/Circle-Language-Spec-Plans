### **Super-Project**
Circle Language Spec
### **Goal**
This describes the part of the project Command as a Concept Spec, that was later put 'out of scope' of the Circle Language Spec super-project.

The original goal also included input, output and throughput, automatic execution order, and how that might solve concurrency issues, but that was postponed to another project.

Disregarding input/output was taken out of the project, preparation was done for it in this project anyway. Because input/output parameters and command input/output are dependent on assignment, and assignment is dependent on the system interface, the topics about the system interface and assignment were also fully worked out.

3 weeks

52 ¼ hours of work
