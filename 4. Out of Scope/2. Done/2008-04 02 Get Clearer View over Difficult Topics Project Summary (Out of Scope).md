Circle Language Spec Plan | Get Clearer View over Difficult Topics | 2008-04 | Project Summary (Out of Scope)
==========================================================================================================


Goal
----

Get clear view on ideas not thought through as well.

Many articles of Computer Language Fundamental Principles were easy to document.

Some of them were harder.

The goal of the project Document Computer Language had two parts: document the ideas I have a clear view on, and get a clear view on important principles not yet fully understood.

I have now reached a point, at which it is starting to ache, that certain ideas are not clear to me yet. And it is ideas that will mess up the original of thinking.

The goal of the project *Get Clearer View* is to get a clear view on the ideas that may change *everything*.

The idea was that most of flat & structured interchange and concepts as external modules would mess up the original way of thinking, and that flat & structure interchange would mess up the diagram expression.  
So basically it is about flat & structured interchange, concepts and diagram expression. They tie together relational and object oriented, and add concept oriented to it.


Super-Project
-------------

Document Computer Language


Means
-----

It was thought, that getting a clearer view would mean writing articles for the following topics:

- Automatic Containment
- Methods & Classes Loosely Coupled
- Concepts As External Modules
- Automatic Execution Order
- Automatic Object Formation

But first of all: the goal did *not* require writing all of these articles, but it was important for me to get a *clear view* on the topics. Second of all, some topics didn’t need to be worked out at all: concepts as external modules didn’t need to be worked out, and automatic object formation did not need to be worked out.


Date & Time
-----------

*(This includes hours of the sub-project Diagram Notation Spec 2008-05, later put out of scope of this super-project.)*

April 13, 2008 – May 27, 2008  
6 weeks and 3 days  
94 ½ hours of work


Products
--------

The following topics got fully worked out articles:

- Automatic Containment
    - version  *2008-04-24 00  1.0*
- Methods & Classes Loosely Coupled
    - version  *2008-05-18 02  1.1*

The following topic only got a brainstorm:

- Automatic Execution Order

The following topics were not considered, because they will have less impact on the language:

- Concepts As External Modules
- Automatic Object Formation


Sub-Projects
------------

The work was split up into the following __*4*__  sub-projects:

- Work out Automatic Containment
- Work out Methods & Classes Loosely Coupled
- Work out Concepts as External Modules (postponed)
- Clarify Automatic Execution Order

After that, I reconsidered my goals.
