Project Summary**

### **Goal**
Fully understand automatic containment again and fully document the idea.

The super project is *Get clearer view*. In that project I was supposed to work out the ideas, that totally mess up the original way of thinking. At the beginning of the project I found out I did not understand automatic containment anymore. I decided to turn working out automatic containment into a separate project, and save the other subjects for later.

I will review old material, and brainstorm until I understand it again, document it fully, including the exact procedure of deriving containment structure out of referential structure.

Automatic Containment will be worked out in the following document:

[Automatic Containment.doc](D:\1. Systems\1. Documentation\1. Software System\XXXX-XX-XX XX\02. Code\03. Flat & Structured Interchanged\1. Containment\1. Automatic Containment\XXXX-XX-XX XX)

The following document and older versions of it might conatin useful information for the project:

[Symbol = Creator](D:\1. Systems\1. Documentation\1. Software System\XXXX-XX-XX XX\02. Code\01. Fundamental Principles\1.1.    Symbol = Creator)

The solution to Automatic Containment was inspired by the *closest mutual parent* principle, described in the original Symbol Language documentation:

[Symbol Language.doc](D:\1. Systems\1. Documentation\1. Software System\XXXX-XX-XX XX\02. Code\05. Expression\3. Diagrams\XXXX-XX-XX XX\Symbol \( Cross Out Copy \)\Symbol Language.doc)

However hard or simple it was to solve the problem: I solved an important discrepancy between Creator and Symbol regarding one being purely referential and the other very containment based. However the simple or hard the solution: it is solved now.

The article [Automatic Containment.doc](D:\1. Systems\1. Documentation\1. Software System\XXXX-XX-XX XX\02. Code\03. Flat & Structured Interchanged\1. Automatic Containment\2008-04-24 00  1.0) was produced,
version *2008-04-24 00  1.0*
