Encircle Language Spec Plan | Clarify Automatic Execution Order | 2008-05 | Project Summary
=========================================================================================


Super-Project
-------------

Document Computer Language, Get Clearer View over Difficult Topics

(This project was originally intermixed with the sub-project *Diagram Notation Specs 2008-05*, but then the scope was split in two.)


Goal
----

After 2 projects of difficult *flat & structured interchange* topics, I was able to choose from two projects:

- Automatic execution order
- Concepts as external modules

First I chose the project *concepts as external modules*. It was much different material compared to the flat & structured interchange topics. It would give me a break from the difficult flat & structured interchange topics.

Automatic execution order may be the last unclarified topic, that has a big influence on the computer language and diagram expression. Automatic containment also needs adaptations, which frustrates me as well. It’s just the highest priority right now in the *Get Clearer View* super-project.

Concepts as External Modules has to wait.  
Automatic Object Formation will not influence the diagram notation much.

The goal of the project is to get a clear view on automatic execution order.

The means of the goal were:

- Work out automatic execution order
- Adapt the article automatic containment

There were plans to write or adapt other articles as well:

- Relational = Object Oriented (new article)
- Class = Prototype (new article)
- Symbol = Creator.doc
- Internet as a single computer.

But after a brainstorm about automatic execution order, the goal of the super project *Get Clearer View* was already reached.  
Automatic execution will have some influence on the diagram, but not a lot.
