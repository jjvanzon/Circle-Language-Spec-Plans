### Introduction

This document tries to list some topics these ideas might entail.

### Topics

- [ ] Math / Operators

    - [ ] Math might be implemented as a library of operators, which may facility those normal expressions that might be familiar from other programming languages: arithmetic, comparison, boolean operations: expressions if you will. A programming language may be incomplete without them. However, in Encircle it might be just a module.

    - [ ] These expressions of combining operators might be expressed as a diagram displaying it as an object graph, but might also be converted to text displayed inside the diagram.

- [ ] Querying & Collection Operations

    - [ ] This phase might be a belated introduction of a relational paradigm into the language.
