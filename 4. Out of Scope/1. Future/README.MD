Encircle Language Spec Plans | Out of Scope | Future
====================================================

Things that might be done in the future for topics that did not make it into the spec. Those might be topics about a [broader view](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Encircle-Language-Spec/tree/master/broader-view) on the uses of the Encircle language. They might also be [construct drafts](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Encircle-Language-Spec/tree/master/constructs-drafts), that may not be ripe for the spec yet.
