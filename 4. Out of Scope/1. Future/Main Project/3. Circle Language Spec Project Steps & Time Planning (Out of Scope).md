Circle Language Spec Plan Steps & Time Planning (Out of Scope)
=============================================================


Purpose of this Document
------------------------

This document subdivides a project into work items and gives a time planning and time estimation for it.

The work described here was deemed out-of-scope of the project *Circle Language Spec*.

----------

**1** = Piece of cake

**2** = Easy

**3** = Average

**4** = Relatively hard

**5** = Very hard

**8** = Extreme but known

**10** = Extreme and unknown

The orange items are postponed and not counted up in the planning.
