Encircle Language Spec | Product List (Out of Scope)
====================================================


Purpose of this Document
------------------------

This document is a raw list of the products to produce in a project. The topics mentioned here are put out of scope of the project *Encircle Language Spec* and may be moved away to another place eventually.


Topics Roughly
--------------

### Construct Drafts

- Text Code Expression

Implementations:

- Achievability
- Optimization

### Broader View

There are also topics about computer language, that just go too far for now:

- Automatic Object Formation
- Object Algebra
- Neural Networks
- Natural Language
- Artificial Intelligence

It would be nice to see, if these could be given a place in the new computer language, but I would not insist on realizing that myself, and could leave that to others, if they even would.

These might explain how things might work in harmony to achieve the 'higher goals'.

- Exchangeability
- Extensibility

How the storage of objects is handled might also be covered in:

- Object Storage

Integration:

- Other Text Codes
- Legacy Text Codes

And:

- Certain utilities

### Totally Out of Scope

- Certain utilities
- Parser
- Text Templates
- Text Operations

#### Aspect Framework

The only (out-of-scope) things that might be desirable to work out for the new computer language are:

- Data Aspects

For the internet to function as a single computer, also the following could be worked out:

- Internet Aspects
- Access Control
- Caching

The following non-computer-language topics could also be covered, to show the power of the language:

- Editing Aspects
- Controls Aspects

However, *Controls Aspects* and *Editing & Authoring* would not be covered anymore. Even though they are power-enhancements to the new computer language they already have a rough description that is adequate.

#### Operating System Components

< JJ van Zon, 2020-01: It might not be appropriate anymore to include the following information, because it seems too much based on the idea, that almost a whole operating system would be programmed. The scope of the project might be more limited than that. >

Core functionality will be borrowed from the operating system:

- Internet Protocol
- Kernel functionality:
    - Threads
    - Memory
    - Disk
    - Device drivers

< JJ van Zon, 2020-01: The following information might not be appropriate to mention anymore, because it references a document, not involved in the project anymore, that is more grander in scope: an OS, a programming language and any commonly used application. >

The new computer language consists of most of the 'Foundation Layer', as described in the document *Software System*. But 'Core' modules described there, will be borrowed from the operating system. The *Core* modules, which constitute an operating system kernel, will at first not be made. One of the ideas, is that the kernel could later be programmed inside the new computer language itself anyway, because you can program machine code in it.

    - [ ] ~ Clause Access
    - [ ] ~ Interface Access

- ##### ~ Libraries

    - ~ Math / Operators

        - Math might be implemented as a library of operators, which may facility those normal expressions that might be familiar from other programming languages: arithmetic, comparison, boolean operations: expressions if you will. A programming language may be incomplete without them. However, in Encircle it might be just a module.

        - These expressions of combining operators might be expressed as a diagram displaying it as an object graph, but might also be converted to text displayed inside the diagram.

    - ~ Querying & Collection Operations

        - This phase might be a belated introduction of a relational paradigm into the language.

- ##### ~ Integration

    - To really prove the language’s power, you might want to be able to navigate existing systems with it. So you might want to be able to express file systems, other text codes, other module systems, relational database, web services and everything in the diagram language and navigate through the systems, navigating through a single diagram. It is not very easy to realize that. The problem is the multiplicity of it: you would have to write an integration module for each system you want to integrate with. But if you could just prove the concept with a couple of systems, or your favorite systems, it may inspire people to say: if you make these integration modules this would be a really really valuable thing.

### ~ Totally Out of Scope

#### ~ Postponed
