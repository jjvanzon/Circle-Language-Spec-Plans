Encircle Language Spec | Product List (Out of Scope)
====================================================


Purpose of this Document
------------------------

This document is a raw list of the products to produce in a project. The topics mentioned here are put out of scope of the project *Encircle Language Spec* and some may be moved away to another place eventually.

- ### Input Output

    - This phase might introduce a way to handle the input/output concept and concurrency.

    - [ ] In, Out & Thru
    - [ ] Input Output Parameter Passing
          *(Parameter passing types from other languages and from a previous attempt to document this language (the 'Symbol Language' documentation) but now put in the context of in/out/thru and input/output in general and extending to automatic execution order and some form of concurrency resolution).*

    - [ ] Math / Operators

        - [ ] Math might be implemented as a library of operators, which may facility those normal expressions that might be familiar from other programming languages: arithmetic, comparison, boolean operations: expressions if you will. A programming language may be incomplete without them. However, in Encircle it might be just a module.

        - [ ] These expressions of combining operators might be expressed as a diagram displaying it as an object graph, but might also be converted to text displayed inside the diagram.

    - [ ] Querying & Collection Operations

        - [ ] This phase might be a belated introduction of a relational paradigm into the language.
        -----

- ### From Spec

    - Groups *Broader View* topics that may be recognizable from the *spec*, but then ideas perhaps more philosophical and lesser to the point.

- ### Integration

    - [ ] To really prove the language’s power, you might want to be able to navigate existing systems with it. So you might want to be able to express file systems, other text codes, other module systems, relational database, web services and everything in the diagram language and navigate through the systems, navigating through a single diagram. It is not very easy to realize that. The problem is the multiplicity of it: you would have to write an integration module for each system you want to integrate with. But if you could just prove the concept with a couple of systems, or your favorite systems, it may inspire people to say: if you make these integration modules this would be a really really valuable thing.
