Circle Language Spec Plan | Text Code Spec | Project Summary
============================================================

*Date: 2008*


Brainstorm
----------

Before this project, most coding concepts would probably have been worked out.  
The diagrammatic expression of those coding concepts may also have been described.  
In this project all textual expressions would be worked out of all the coding concepts, that were already worked out.  
You would not have to be concerned with the 'literals' approach of text code.
