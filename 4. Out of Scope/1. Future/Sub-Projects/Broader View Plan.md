Encircle Language Spec Plans
============================

Broader View Plan

### 2019-12-29 Postponed Encircle Broader View / Gap Lifting

Also I had ideas on the other end of the spectrum, more macroscopically: how far can I take the application of this diagram notation? Could they even substitute user-interfaces? Could boundaries be lifted, for instance, between things running on different computers and the boundary between users and programmers. The language gaps between things like files and folders, databases, programming languages, user interfaces... gaps between the physical and the logical. All that. I thought that was interesting to think about.

### 2021-01-23 Postponed Encircle Broader View / Object Storage

I kind of like this sentence:
*"Object Storage* basically turns lists on storage devices into a landscape of digital objects."
I think I got caught in the deletion process when isolating Encircle Language Docs out of Software System Docs.
