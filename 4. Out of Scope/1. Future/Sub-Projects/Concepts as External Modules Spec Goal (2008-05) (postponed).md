Circle Language Spec Plan | 2008-05 | Fundamental Principles | Concepts as External Modules Spec
=============================================================================================

*Date: May, 2008*

Goal
----

*Project postponed*

This project is part of the super project *Get clearer view*, which is part of the super project *Work out Computer Language Fundamental Principles*.

After 2 projects of difficult *flat & structured interchange* topics, I was able to choose from two projects:

\- Automatic execution order

\- Concepts as external modules

Automatic execution order was another hard flat & structured interchange topic. I’ve already forgotten the reasons why to pick that one.

Concepts as external modules gives me a break from the flat & structured interchange topics, and a break from diagram notation that gets messed up by flat & structured interchange. Concepts as external modules might also be an easier topic.

There is a general article about it in Computer Language Fundamental Principles, that is only to give the functional outline of principle. There is also an article Concepts in the Computer Language Coding Principles, that would give a formal description of how concepts work in the language.

I don’t have any more than that, do I?

I don’t have an article where I brainstorm about it, until I get it right and produce a lengthy, difficult description about it.

So I think I’ll start in Computer Language Fundamental Principles, and start brainstorming.

\- Programming concepts

\- Supporting concepts
