Encircle Language Spec Plan | Aspect Spec | Project Summary
===========================================================

*Date: 2008*

Introduction
------------

This phase finally introduces the aspect coding construct, which might replace code generation by an alternative solution. The aspects is pretty much equal to the aspect construct known from aspect oriented programming.


Brainstorm
----------

The reason for the sub-project *Work Out Concepts As External Modules* might have been that it might play a role in a possibly powerful concept of 'aspects' (which I once called 'concepts').

But I already have an idea how concepts as external modules will be, and even though it then might be relevant to document it, another idea seemed unclearer so may have shifted the focus.


Not Working Out the 'Aspects' Topic First
-----------------------------------------

*Note that the concept construct is still in scope of the Encircle Language Spec project, though a postponed work item. The descriptions about it here, seem too confusing to share, though.*

What you can see, is that the power of software system and the new computer language might be very dependent on the workings of the *concept* programming construct. They are pretty much the 'aspects' from 'aspect oriented programming'. Much of my ideas for software consists of *concept* modules, such as *Coding Concepts, Data Concepts, Internet Concepts, Controls Concepts* and *Editing & Authoring Concepts*. Those are all power-enhancements of software, that may be immediately applied to any system without any further programming. (Perhaps only when the base of the software is a structure of 'entities' with relations between each other.)

It is quite tempting to start working out how implementation of concept modules works in the new computer language, because it may be an important idea, not adequately worked out yet. But even though it seems important to work out first, the pragmatic thing to do is still to first work out the ideas, that are already clear to me. Because, that will go the fastest, and is more in the line of the general goal I have with the projects I do: my ideas more easily picked up by others.  
And also: when those ideas are clear on paper, they are more crystal clear in my head, and possibly during the working out of those ideas, the other ideas, not yet as clear, will have become clearer, by having the chance to settle.

So the bottom line is: after the current project do not work out the important principle of aspects, but work out the ideas, that are easy to work out, because they are already clear to me.
