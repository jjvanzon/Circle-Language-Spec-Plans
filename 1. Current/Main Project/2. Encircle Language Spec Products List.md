Encircle Language Spec | Product List
=====================================


Purpose of this Document
------------------------

This document might be a raw list of the products that can be produced within the project *Encircle Language Spec*. The goal and strategy were already described in another document, called *Encircle Language Spec Strategy.*


Topic List Detailed
-------------------

Roughly ordered by level of difficulty (roughly equal to the priority). This list might be quite large, because of the split up into smaller topics.

You may find a lack of explanations here. If there were an explanation of a topic, you might find it in the actual Encircle Language Spec documentation itself or perhaps in a matching document in the *Sub-Projects* folder. If it is not there, there might simply *be* no explanation text yet and it might be an aim of the sub-project to produce just that.
