Encircle Language Spec | Product List
=====================================


Introduction
------------

This document tries to list the things that might be produced in the project *Encircle Language Spec*.

You may find a lack of explanations here. If there were an explanation of a topic, you might be able to find it in the actual *Encircle Language Spec* documentation or in a document in the *Sub-Projects* folder perhaps. There might simply *be* no explanation text yet and it may be an aim of the sub-project to produce that.

### TODO

#### General Issues

These topics may be about general restructurings of the works.

- [x] ~ Source Control Migration
    - [ ] ~ Might still including hour sheet  
            (Extracting it from hour sheet about multiple projects.)
- [x] Publishing to GitHub
- [x] Conversion to MarkDown
- [ ] .. Planning | in General
- [ ] .. Scoping
- [ ] .. Content Reorganization

#### Tone Change

There may be a desire to change the tone of the documentation to milder language. Details might be found in sub-project documentation.

#### Content Changes

These topics might already be in the spec, but specific changes might be desired. Those desired changes, may be found in sub-project descriptions.

One possible task may be correcting for new insight / decisions. For instance, the *assignment* notation may have undergone a few changes and the other documentation may not have been adapted to that yet.

Content changes may also be addressed while changing the *tone* of a document. Sometimes it may seem redundant work, to change the wording of text that seems mostly deprecated, so content changes may sometimes happen before tone change.

#### Constructs Unfinished

These are constructs that might be desired and may hardly have a description in the spec yet.

- [ ] Object Resolution | Language Design

#### Language Design

These topics may be more significant changes to how the language would be described. Some are extensions that may be optional for now.

- [ ] Fully OO. Is It? | Language Design
    - [ ] Operators | Language Design
        - [ ] Arithmetic, comparative, logical, bit, string

    - [ ] Union Types | Language Design
    - [ ] ...
-----
- [ ] Access Marks Redo | Language Design
    - [ ] (Make them arrows by default? Think of something different for protected? Reconsider all 'marks' on lines, like Conditions and special access modifiers?)
- [ ] Large Lists Problem | Language Design
-----
- [ ] Pointers Separate Chapter | Language Design
- [ ] More Pictures | Language Design
-----
- [ ] Relationships NOT Always Bidirectional | Language Design

-----
- [ ] Simplify Rules | Language Design

#### Out of Scope

These topics might not be part of the spec (yet). They may be found under the Construct Drafts or Broader View sections of the Encircle-Language-Spec repository. These topics might be moved to separate doc for Out of Scope things. Perhaps some things may disappear from the project entirely.

- [ ] Construct Drafts | Aspect | Language Design
- [ ] Construct Drafts | Conversions | Language Design
- [ ] Construct Drafts | Errors & Warnings | Language Design
