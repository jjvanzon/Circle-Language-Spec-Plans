Encircle Language Spec | Product List
=====================================


Purpose of this Document
------------------------

This document might be a raw list of the products that can be produced within the project *Encircle Language Spec*. The goal and strategy were already described in another document, called *Encircle Language Spec Strategy.*


Topic List Detailed
-------------------

You may find a lack of explanations here. If there were an explanation of a topic, you might find it in the actual Encircle Language Spec documentation or in a document in the *Sub-Projects* folder perhaps. There might simply *be* no explanation text yet and it may be an aim of the sub-project to produce just that.

### TODO

#### General

These topics may be about general restructurings of the works.

- [x] ~ Source Control Migration
    - [ ] ~ Might including hour sheet  
            (Extracting it from hour sheet about multiple projects.)
- [x] Publishing to GitHub
- [x] Conversion to MarkDown
- [ ] .. Scoping
- [ ] .. Content Reorganization
- [ ] .. Planning | in General

#### Tone Change

There may be a desire to change the tone of the documentation to milder language. Details might be found in sub-project documentation.

#### Content Changes

These topics might already be in the spec, but changes to their descriptions might be desired. Those desired changes, may be found in sub-project descriptions.

One possible task may be correcting for new insight / decisions. Dot instance, the *assignment* notation underwent a few changes and not all the documentation may have been adapted to it yet.

Content changes may also be addressed while changing the tone of a document. Sometimes it may seem redundant work, to change the wording of text that seems mostly deprecated, so content changes may sometimes happen before tone change.

#### Constructs Unfinished

These are constructs that might be desired and may hardly have a description in the spec yet.

- [ ] Object Resolution | Language Design
- [ ] Conditions | Language Design
- [ ] Object Order | Language Design
- [ ] Static Notation | Language Design
- [ ] Comment Notation | Language Design
- [ ] List Concept More Generic | Language Design
- [ ] Diagram Metrics | Language Design
- [ ] Diagram Coloring | Language Design

#### Language Design

These topics may be more significant changes to how the language would be described. Some are extensions that may be optional for now.

- [ ] Fully OO, Is It? | Language Design
    - [ ] Operators | Language Design
        - [ ] Arithmetic, comparative, logical, bit, string
    - [ ] Modifiers | Language Design

    - [ ] Structs | Language Design
    - [ ] Union Types | Language Design
    - [ ] ...
-----
- [ ] Access Marks Redo | Language Design
    - [ ] (Make them arrows by default? Think of something different for protected? Reconsider all 'marks' on lines, like Conditions and special access modifiers?)
- [ ] Large Lists Problem | Language Design
-----
- [ ] Pointers Separate Chapter | Language Design
- [ ] More Pictures | Language Design
-----
- [ ] Relationships NOT 'Always' Bidirectional | Language Design

-----
- [ ] Simplify Rules | Language Design
- [ ] Purity Lost | Language Design
    - [ ] (With implicit notations?)

#### Out of Scope

These topics might not be part of the spec (yet). They may be found under the Construct Drafts or Broader View sections of the Encircle-Language-Spec repository. These topics might be moved to separate doc for Out of Scope things. Perhaps some things may disappear from the project entirely.

- [ ] Construct Drafts | Input / Output | Language Design
- [ ] Construct Drafts | Aspect | Language Design
- [ ] Construct Drafts | Conversions | Language Design
- [ ] Construct Drafts | Errors & Warnings | Language Design
- [ ] Construct Drafts | Libraries | Language Design
- [ ] Broader View | Interfaces | Extensive Classification with Interfaces
