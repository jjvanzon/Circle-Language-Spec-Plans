Encircle Language Spec 
======================

Revamp | 2019-08 | Notes
------------------------

### Introduction

*Encircle* is an unfinished programming language.

I spent quite some time in my 20's thinking about this idea of how to visually express the internals of computers and programming languages.

*Encircle Language Spec* tries to describe it.

This project *Encircle Language Spec | Revamp* might be an umbrella project about multiple topics. The main point may be to change the *form* of the spec documents:

- Scoping more sharply
- Converting to web-friendly format
- Publishing
- Changing tone
 
When changing a topic's *tone*, perhaps *content changes* might be addressed too.

There might be separate sub-project documents about specific topics.

### Steps

- [x] Reorientation
    - [x] Reading Planning Docs sequentially.
- [x] Source Control Migration
- [x] Publishing to GitHub
- [x] Conversion to MarkDown
- [ ] __Rough Content Reorganization__
- [ ] .. Scoping
- [ ] .. Planning | in General
- [ ] .. Tone Change
- [ ] ~ Including hour sheet
    - [ ] ~ (Extracting from hour sheet about multiple projects)
- [ ] ~ Improving Encircle Language Spec:
    - [x] Reduce the number of articles, grouping topics together.
    - [x] Turn separate Concept / Diagram / Text Code articles into one.
    - [ ] .. Loose ideas (regroup or clear out)
    - [ ] ~ Start reading / writing / reformulating.
    - [ ] ~ Generally go through content reformulating things?
    - [ ] ~ Reorganizing articles
    - [ ] ~ Language design issues
    - [ ] ~ Correcting for new insight / decisions
