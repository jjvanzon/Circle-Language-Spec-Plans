Project Outline
---------------

### Introduction

*Encircle* is an unfinished programming language.

I spent quite some time in my 20's thinking about this idea of how to visually express the internals of computers and programming languages.

*Encircle Language Spec* tries to describe it.

This project *Encircle Language Spec Revamp* might change the *form* of the spec documents:

- Scoping more sharply
- Publishing
- Changing tone
- Converting to web-friendly format
 
When changing a topic's *tone*, perhaps *content changes* might be addressed too.

There may be separate sub-project documents about specific topics.

### Steps

- [x] Reorientation
    - [x] Reading Planning Docs sequentially.
- [x] Scoping
    - [x] Splitting "Software System" / "Encircle Language"
    - [x] Splitting "Encircle Docs" / "Circle 3 Programming" (splitting documentation goals from programming goals.)
        - [x] Ideas.doc too
    - [x] Splitting 'in scope' / 'out of scope' for Encircle Language topics.
    - [x] Splitting up 'phases in life' in planning docs.
    - [x] Removed studying goals.
    - [ ] ... Splitting up "Language Spec" / "Broader View" / "Construct Drafts"
        - [x] Encircle-Language-Spec repository
        - [ ] ~ Encircle-Language-Spec-Plans repository
- [x] Version control migration
- [x] Publishing to GitHub
- [x] Conversion to MarkDown
- [x] Rough content reorganization
    - [ ] __Reorganizing Planning Docs__
    - [x] Reorganizing "Encircle Docs" roughly
    - [x] Reorganizing "Spec" roughly
    - [x] Reorganizing "Broader View" roughly
    - [x] Reorganizing "Construct Drafts" roughly
    - [x] Moving topics out of "Spec"
- [ ] .. Milder tone
    - [ ] .. More open, less resolute language
    - [ ] .. Use common IT terms
    - [ ] .. Less resolute language, more wiggle room
    - [ ] .. (Perhaps search for definites such as 'have to', 'must', 'will', 'should', 'very'.)
    - [ ] .. (Maybe I am being too strict towards myself, about having to rewrite everything in a milder tone.)
- [ ] ~ Including hour sheet
    - [ ] ~ (Extracting from hour sheet about multiple projects)
- [ ] ~ Improving Planning Docs:
    - [ ] ~ Splitting "Encircle Language Spec Revamp Notes" into a document per topic.
- [ ] ~ Improving Encircle Language Spec:
    - [x] Reduce the number of articles, grouping topics together.
    - [x] Turn separate Concept / Diagram / Text Code articles into one.
    - [ ] .. Loose ideas (regroup or clear out)
    - [ ] ~ Start reading / writing / reformulating.
    - [ ] ~ Generally go through content reformulating things?
    - [ ] ~ Reorganizing articles
    - [ ] ~ Language design issues
    - [ ] ~ Correcting for new insight / decisions

### Rough Content Reorganization

#### TODO

##### 2021-03-30 TODO Rough Content Reorganization

- [ ] .. Merging together goals of Revamp project with Main Project.
    - [ ] Encircle Language Spec Strategy
        - [x] Reformulating Main Project "Goals" sections.
        - [x] Reformulating Main Project "Theme Picking" section.
        - [x] Reformulating Main Project "Productive Writing" section.
        - [x] Perhaps do not describe goals *once had* but *never reached*.
        - [x] Perhaps better describe what *happened* and goals *now*.
        - [x] *Time planning* issues may not be appropriate anymore.
        - [x] I cannot do *efficient* anymore.
        - [ ] Perhaps read over again later.
    - [ ] .. Encircle Language Spec Products List
        - [ ] .. Might build up a new list.
        - [ ] And go over old list items and cross them out.
        - [ ] Sub-elaborations may go to sub-project docs.
    - [ ] Sub-Projects
        - [ ] Grouping folders for "Sub-Projects"?
        - [ ] README.MD in some folders / "Sub-Projects" folder?
    - [ ] Encircle Language Spec Steps & Time Planning
- [ ] Splitting Revamp Notes into sub-project docs for more specific things
    - [x] "Encircle Language Spec Revamp" > "Writing Style" section may have things for sub-projects.
    - [x] like Tone Change, Source Control Migration, etc.
    - [ ] __More general things too__

#### Postponed

##### 2021-03-23 Postponed Rough Content Reorganization

- [ ] Planning docs: Removing (totally) out-of-scope topics to Archive.
- [ ] Contents sections in documents?
- [ ] ~ Moves to "Implementations"
- [ ] All pointer topics to Pointers.
- [ ] All Text Code topics to single place.
- [ ] Replacing the name: "new computer language" with "Encircle programming language" or "Encircle".
- [ ] Switching "Parameters" approach between "Spec" and "Construct Drafts" replacing the "Commands & Classes Loosely Coupled" approach with the "Input Output" approach.
- [ ] ~ Splitting up Black Box Construct Drafts (they seem disparate topics)
- [ ] ->.. Replacing "Concept" with "Aspect"
    - [ ] I have difficulty with this. 
    - [ ] Only part of the occurrences seem replaceable.
    - [ ] "Concept" had such a nice ring to it.
    - [ ] Maybe some other way to be selective?
    - [ ] Certain files perhaps?
- [ ] ~ Reorganizing "Fundamental Principles"
    - [ ] ~ One doc for Exchangeability?
    - [ ] ~ One doc for Extensibility?
- [ ] ~ Renaming "System Objects" chapter to "System Interfaces"?

##### 2020-05-14 Postponed Encircle Broader View / Construct Drafts Neater Folders

- Making folder sub-division neater of "Framework" (inside Software-System-Docs), now that the topics have found a new place. 

#### Done

##### 2021-03-23 Done Rough Content Reorganization

- [x] Updating headings to reflect new folder organization.
- [x] Moved images (after the folder organization changes).
- [x] Spreading content of "Implementation Attempt 2002": Some to "Text Code", some to "Optimization".
- [x] Moves from "Construct Drafts" to "Broader View":
    - [x] "Commands & Classes Loosely Coupled"
    - [x] "Multiple Language Layers"
    - [x] "Object Storage"
- [x] ~~Spreading "Old Or Boring" topics over the documents. > Cannot find it anymore.~~
- [x] Correcting links from Plans repo's Readme to Spec repo.
- [x] Planning docs: Splitting up Revamp project into topics.
    - [x] Some work might be Done project, bot others might be half Done, half TODO, which might make it a Current project. Perhaps Moving Done, TODO and Postponed together under a topic might create overview to see the distiction, before spreading things over multiple documents.

##### 2021-03-14 Done Rough Content Reorganization

- [x] Moves from "Spec" to "Construct Drafts":
    - [x] "Previous Versions"
    - [x] "Summaries of Other Languages"
- [x] Make folder subdivision neater, now that the topics have found a new place. 
    - [x] "Encircle Language Spec"
    - [x] "Encircle Constructs Drafts"
    - [x] "Encircle Broader View"
- [x] Spec contents page (with links)
    - [x] Removing links to folders (confusing).
- [x] 'Webby paths' / 'pretty URL's' (shallow paths, lower-case, dashes, no spaces)
- [x] Moving System Objects more to the top again.
- [x] Calling "Ideas" "Loose Ideas".
- [x] Adding things like:
    - [x] `[ Deprecated documentation ]`
    - [x] `[ Preliminary documentation ]`
    - [x] `[ Out of scope ]`
- [x] index pages:
    - [x] Creating / updating.
    - [x] One in each folder.
    - [x] Also might move sub-folder descriptions from more general index pages to more specific ones.
    - [x] (Relative) links in all index pages
- [x] Removing "Version History" documents from Archive?
- [x] Replacing "Globality" with "Module"
- [x] "From Spec" sub-folders in "Construct Drafts" and "Broader View"
- [x] Split "Fundamental Principles Overview" over "Exchangeability", "Extensibility" and "Achievability".
- [x] Merging together "Flat and Structured Interchange" documents.

##### 2020-05-24 Done Merge More Articles

- [x] More articles from the first chapters might be merged together.
- [x] Structure changes:
    - [x] Making back ground black?
    - [x] Changing main headers?
    - [x] ~~Removing the footers?~~
    - [x] ~~Removing 'see also' references?~~
    - [x] Convert to docx.
    - [x] Merging or redistributing articles?
- [x] Chapters
    - [x] Objects
    - [x] Classes
    - [x] Relationships
    - [x] System Objects
    - [x] Commands

##### 2020-05-27 Done Merging More Commands Articles Together

- [x] Redirection and recursion seem to have some overlap conceptually.
- [x] Maybe "05. Comparison to CPU-Like Calls belongs in 04. Creation Behavior Of Commands."
- [x] "01. Commands Main Concepts > Larger" > Keep separate
- [x] "02. Start & Stop > Larger" > Keep separate
- [x] "03. Parent Controls Its Sub-Executions" > Medium sized > Misc-ish
- [x] "04. Creation Behavior Of Commands" > Larger
- [x] "05. Comparison to CPU-Like Calls" > Medium sized > Might group into Creation Behavior Of Commands
- [x] "06. Command Redirection" > Medium sized
- [x] "07. Recursion" > Medium sized / smallish > Might group into Command Redirection.
- [x] "08. Command Referrers" > Smaller > Misc-ish
- [x] "09. Commands Example Diagrams" > Larger > Keep separate
- [x] "10. Commands Ideas" > Larger > Keep separate
- [x] "11. This (unfinished)" > Smaller > Misc-ish

##### 2020-05-26 Done Merging More System Objects Articles Together

- [x] Last time it seems I only merged together a few large groups of articles into their main topic.
- [x] Right now I feel maybe the first 5 could be merged into one.
- [x] Along with some main topics, I feel there are loose topics. Maybe those loose topics could be grouped together with something.
- [x] I think Connectors and Connections is something I might want to combine into one article.
- [x] Assignment I would like to keep separate for now.
- [x] System Command Call Notations too. It's kind of large and honestly a bit questionable, so I would like to keep that separate.
- [x] I am thinking the remaining 4 relatively small articles, might be combined into a System Objects Misc article.
- [x] "01. System Objects" > Larger > Keep separate
- [x] "02. Assignment" > Medium sized > Keep separate
- [x] "03. System Command Call Notations" > Larger > Keep separate
- [x] "04. Connectors" > Smaller > Combined into Connectors & Connections.
- [x] "05. Connections" > Medium sized > Combined into Connectors & Connections.
- [x] "06. System Command Calls by User" > Small > Put into single article System Objects Misc Issues.
- [x] "07. Objects Floating Around" > Small > Put into single article System Objects Misc Issues.
- [x] "08. System Command Extension" > Small > Put into single article System Objects Misc Issues.
- [x] "09. Parameters For Objects" > Medium sized > Put into single article System Objects Misc Issues.
- [x] "10. List Concept" > Medium sized > Keep separate
- [x] "11. System Objects Ideas" > Larger > Keep separate

##### 2020-05-25 Done Merging More Relationships Articles Together

I feel merging the articles together is not something I necessarily want to do right now. I am not sure why those two things are connected to each other in my view.

I guess I feel I might want to polish up the way I explain things, before I put effort into merging the articles together at all? Are the articles not particularly small, like some of the articles I merged together before?

Some articles are smallish or sort of medium sized. I think I could just make it one article. That may make it more manageable the way I would like. I do not see my not entirely agreeing with the concept anymore as standing in the way of that.

Still want to change the fonts.

##### 2020-05-16 Done Formatting and Article Merging and Distributing

- [x] ~~Maybe put Type Control out of scope? > Deemed less important to consider right now.~~
- [x] So, what's next?
- [x] I think nothing to reorganize anymore about the file structure of Encircle Language Spec.
- [x] Maybe start with the texts?
- [x] ~~Option: Convert to docx. > Too many docs.~~
- [x] Option: If there are still Text Code topics, they might be moved to Encircle Construct Drafts.
- [x] Structure changes:
    - [x] Making back ground black?
    - [x] Changing main headers?
    - [x] Removing the footers?
    - [x] Removing 'see also' references?
    - [x] Convert to docx.
    - [x] Merging or redistributing articles?
    - [x] Putting each conceptual and diagram explanation together in an article.
- [x] Chapters:
    - [x] Encircle Language Spec Overview
    - [x] Basic Diagram Elements
    - [x] Objects
    - [x] Classes
    - [x] Relationships
    - [x] System Objects
    - [x] Commands
    - [x] Parameters
    - [x] Module
    - [x] Execution Control
    - [x] Black Boxing
    - [x] Interfaces
    - [x] Events
    - [x] Inheritance
    - [x] > The next are 26 documents total. I might do formatting for all of them in one go. None of the folders seem to have large sets of articles anymore.
    - [x] Type Control
    - [x] Object Resolution
    - [x] Conditions
    - [x] Object Order
    - [x] Uncategorized
    - [x] Other Diagram Topics
    - [x] Summaries of Other Languages
    - [x] Previous Versions

##### 2020-05-24 Done Merging and Redistributing Remaining Articles

Maybe going into detail about this is not part of the editing phase I am putting these articles through.
This is what the Encircle Language Spec Overview calls the 'unfinished' part. So for that reason it seems less straight forward.
It is also harder to subdivide, because it is multiple different issues, unlike previous tasks I did, which were just about 1 main topic.
The question I have for myself is how much is worth doing with regards to these topics.
Some things I'd like to do.
But I might want to be selective about it.

- [x] ~~"Type Safety, Genericity, Explicit"~~
    - [x] Already 1 article. The topic seems to deserve its own spot.
- [x] ~~"21. Object Resolution"~~
    - [x] Seems all of the articles might be put in one article, because I estimate these are not big issues separately.
    - [x] A lot of the text is preliminary.
    - [x] I do see this as being appropriate as a separate chapter, I think.
    - [x] I do not see much of a reason to put effort into this right now.
    - [x] It's kind of messy and when putting it into one article now, I may lose the overview that the split up into articles gives me now.
- [x] ~~Conditions~~
    - [x] These 3 articles could become 1.
    - [x] It seems that if content is still messy, the split up into multiple articles might have value, because it seems to create overview.
    - [x] Just added some comment on other content about Conditions to find elsewhere.
- [x] "23. Object Order"
    - [x] Is one article.
    - [x] But not a big one.
    - [x] Makes me wonder if some topics are handy as a separate chapter or better grouped into another main topic.
    - [x] Eventually might move to the Objects chapter, but will keep it in its own folder for now.
- [x] "This"
    - [x] I think I already had a place in mind for that, to move this article to a different main topic. I think tso Commands, but I think I put that down in the planning doc Encircle Language Spec Product List.
    - [x] Encircle Language Spec Product List says that it should belong in the Commands chapter.
- [x] "Redirection"
    - [x] Encircle Language Spec Product List does not seem to assign a specific existing Chapter to it. It says 'ref-ness'? Maybe that pointer to pointer situations might all be put in a separate chapter, this might also belong there?
    - [x] It talks about 'target symbols'.
    - [x] There are several target symbol topics in e.g. the chapters Objects, Classes and Interfaces.
    - [x] Maybe that can all go to a chapter about ref-ness, or whatever generic term I might find for it.
    - [x] If it is just about target symbols, maybe the topics are already covered by the previous content.
    - [x] It does seem to be about redirecting e.g. the object aspect and then about tracing to the final target object/class/interface after following the redirections.
    - [x] I do like the idea of a Pointers chapter or something.
    - [x] This content does seem to be covered elsewhere.
    - [x] Perhaps I should just make a folder 'Pointers' and put it there, and a readme just to make a point, that it could just become a separate chapter.
- [x] "30. Misc Diagram Topics"
    - [x] I think this is appropriate as a separate chapter.
    - [x] "1. Diagram Expression Introduction" > Larger
    - [x] "2. About Programming In General" > Larger
    - [x] "3. Diagram Metrics" > Larger or will be.
    - [x] "4. Coloring" > Smaller
    - [x] "6.0. Example Diagrams Introduction" > Small
        - [x] Maybe move to the folder 6.1. Example Diagrams? Maybe call it Readme?
- [x] "7. Summaries of Other Languages"
    - [x] Larger
- [x] "32. Previous Versions"
    - [x] This folder structure seems off when there is essentially only one version, as one document in it.
    - [x] (There used to be multiple versions in one folder. Those were put out of scope of the Encircle Language Spec.)

##### 2020-05-23 Done Merging Inheritance Articles Together

Most of them are quite small.
Grouping together main concepts into one article might make sense.
Specialization is mostly small articles, but quite a few of them. But maybe combine those into one article.
The articles that follow do not seem to be many or they are already larger ones I might not want to group together.

```
- 01. Inheritance Introduction > Smaller
- 02. Inheritance Main Concepts > Smaller
- 03.        Class Inheritance > Smaller
- 04.        Object Inheritance > Smaller
- 05.        List Inheritance > Smaller
- 06.        System Inheritance > Medium-sized / smaller
- 07.        Interface Inheritance > Smaller
- 07. Specialization > Smaller
- 08.        Specialization & Data Replacement > Smaller
- 09.        Altering the Member Set > Smaller
- 10.             Member Addition > Smaller
- 11.             Member Exclusion > Medium-sized / smaller
- 12.             Member Inclusion > Smaller
- 14.        Detouring Members > Smaller
- 15.             Shadowing > Medium-sized / smaller
- 16.             Overriding > Medium-sized
- 17.        Altering Command Implementations > Smaller
- 18.             Command Extension > Smaller
- 19.             System Command Extension > Smaller
- 20.             System Command Overriding > Smaller
- 21.             System Command Shadowing > Smaller
- 22.             System Command Extension By Shadowing > Smaller
- 23.             System Command Extension By Overriding (Questionable) > Smaller
- 24.             System Command Overriding By Extension > Smaller
- 25.        Destructive & Non-Destructive Specialization Methods > Smaller
- 26. Misc Inheritance Situations > Medium-sized / smaller
    - > Moved to Inheritance Main Concepts.
- 27. Enforcing & Preventing Specialization > Larger > Would probably keep it separate.
- 28. Deeper Specialization.docx > Larger > Would probably keep it separate.
- 29. Alternate Version Through Inheritance > Smaller
    - > Maybe move this detail elsewhere.
        Might not be worth an entirely separate article.
- 30.1. Extending System Objects (Older) > Larger
    - > Not sure what the status of this is? It has the word 'Older' in it.
        Is it deprecated? Covered elsewhere already?
        I don't know. But at this stage maybe I do not need to know.
- 30.1. Extending System Objects in a Diagram (Older) > Medium-sized / smaller
    - > Would probably merge it with the main article.
- 31. Inheritance Ideas > Medium-sized
```

##### 2020-05-22 Done Merging Events Articles Together

Possibly this is one you want to put into a single document.  
Most of them are small.
"13. Qualified Event Names" should be out of scope, since it is about text code?  
The articles before 'System Events' might be put into one article.  
I might put System Events in one article.  
System Events can almost be demoted to a Construct Draft, but just like System Objects is in there, I might want to keep System Events part of the Encircle Language Spec (for now). (The correspondence between System Objects and System Events is that they seem more like part of a run-time or if Encircle would function more like a stand-alone language, rather than mostly a diagram notation).  
The last 3 articles might become a single 'misc' article. But perhaps some of them have a place in the main article.

```
- 01. Events Introduction > Smaller
- 02. Prime Event Example, Button Clicked > Smaller
- 03. Events Main Concepts > Smallish
- 04. Event Situations > Smallish
- 05. Explicit Implementation of Event Object > Smaller
- 06. Explicit Interface of Event Object > Smaller
- 07. Event Interface Reference > Smaller
- 08. System Events > Medium sized / smaller
- 09.        System Events in Normal Notation > Smaller
- 10.        Simplified System Event Notation > Medium sized
- 11.        System Event Parameters > Medium sized / smaller
- 12.        System Event Design Choices > Smaller
- 13. Qualified Event Names > Smaller << out of scope >>
- 14. Interaction Events > Smaller
- 15. Black Boxing Events > Medium sized / smaller
- 16. Event Alternatives> Smaller
- 99. Ideas > Smallish
```

##### 2020-05-22 Done Merging Interfaces Articles Together

```
- 01. Interfaces Introduction > Small
- 02. Interfaces Main Concepts.docx > Medium sized
- 03. Interface Aspect.docx > Small
- 04.        System Commands for the Interface Aspect.docx > Medium sized / small
- 05.        System Commands for the Interface Merging Aspect.docx > Small
- 06.        Interface Aspect in System Interface.docx > Medium sized / small
- 07.        Interface Assignment Types.docx > Medium sized
- 08.        Interface System Command Calls.docx > Medium size
- 09.        Interface Connectors.docx > Small
- 10.        Interface Connections.docx > Small
- 11.        New Command with Interface Parameter.docx > Small
- 12. Command Interfaces.docx > Small < <use case >>
- 13. Interface Referencing and Redirecting.docx > Small << notation demonstration >>
- 14. Member Grouping.docx > Medium sized / small << edge-case >>
- 15. Relationships Through Interfaces.docx > Medium sized << notation demonstration >>
- 16. Interface Referrers.docx > Small << edge-case >>
- 17. Reliability of Interfaces.docx > Medium sized / small << edge-case >>
- 18. Group By Source.docx > Medium sized / small << out of scope? >>
- 19. Imaginary Backward Relationships.docx > Small << out of scope? >>
- 20. Target Interfaces.docx > Medium sized, because of ideas, main text is small. << main concept >>
- 21. Mutual Commands, Mutual Interfaces (Unfinished).docx > Small << construct draft >>
- 22. Extensive Classification with Interfaces (Unfinished).docx > Small << construct draft >>
- 99. Interfaces Ideas.docx > Small > Move to main article.
```

None of the articles are that big. The size differences are a bit all over the place.
Logically I might group together all Interface Aspects articles.
The Intro and Main Concepts seem logical to group.
I think I'll just start with those and take it from there.
There's something about text code in Interface Assignment Types. That could be moved to Encircle Construct Drafts.
Maybe move the Loose Ideas all to a separate article at the end.

I discuss problems with interface reliability in case of automatically established bidirectional relationships. The idea of always having bidirectional relationships between things is something I want to distance myself from in the Encircle Language Spec, and perhaps leave as a topic for Encircle Construct Drafts. But right now the idea seems embedded into the Encircle Language Spec, and without significant modification, it does not seem you can deprecate it yet. I think such redesign of Relationships may take place in the future (to leave out automatic bidirectional relationships). But I think it is only then that I also adapt the text about this edge cases. So the question that worried me is whether it is out of scope or not. The answer for now seems to be: no, it is in scope, but the design of the concept of Relationships may be changed in later efforts.

##### 2020-05-20 Done Merging Black Boxes Articles Together

There are quite a few relatively small articles.
But I have doubts how to group them to bigger articles.
I do not think I want to group them together just in one big article.
I might just go for it, grouping the first smaller articles into a bigger one.

- Smaller, integrated into a single article:
    - "01. Black Box Introduction"
    - "02. Black Box Main Concepts"
    - "03. Public & Private"

    - "05. Notations of Private"
    - "06. Friend Declaration in Instances"

    - "09. Object-Bound, Reference-Bound & Access Control"
    - "13. Assignment between Friend Members"
    - "14. Friend = Wavy Line"
- Group these together:
    - "10. Public & Private Connectors > Kinda medium sized"
    - "11. Public & Private Connections > Relatively bigger."
    - "12. Public & Private Assignment > Kinda medium sized."
- Putting these together in one article:
    - "20. Black Box Miscellaneous Issues"
        - Looks unfinished.
        - Objects Take Over Class Access Control: Might move to article Black Boxes, section Friend Declarations in Instances.
    - "21. Black Box Side-Issues"
        - Looks unfinished.
        - Might move these Encircle Broader View:
            - Black Boxing and User Access Control
            - Programmers and Users
    - "22. Black Box Details, May Cover Last"
        - Unfinished drafts.

            - Get For Access and Get For Copy
            - Inaccessible System Aspects
            - Compared to Traditional Black Boxing (goes in too deep on automatic containment)
            - Other Details
        - Special case:
            - Simplified Access Connectors: I think those ideas could be moved to Simplified Access Control Notation, because that is what they are about. Big brainstorm though.
    - "23. Black Box Details, Might Not Cover"
        - Same as above.
        - Moving it to Encircle Construct Drafts after some considerations.
- "23.3. Black Box Details, May Not Cover, Simplified Access Control Expression in a Diagram"
    - Left it for what it is. Am not calling it unfinished. It seems finished. Maybe might change in the future, but it looks like a worked out idea.
- Moved from Encircle Language Spec to Encircle Construct Drafts:
    - "23.1. Black Box Details, May Not Cover, Simplified Access Control Expression"
    - "23.2. Black Box Details, May Not Cover, Simplified Access Control Expression in Text Code"

##### 2020-05-20 Done Merging Execution Control Articles Together

- [x] I think I want to merge it into the following set of articles:
    - [x] "1.0.1. Introduction to Execution Control"
    - [x] "2.0.1. Conditional Execution"
    - [x] "3.0.1. Loops"
    - [x] "4.0.1. Jumps"
    - [x] "5.0.1. Loop-Related Jumps"
- [x] Reason: I had almost merged it into one document, but I like how the separate documents seem to nicely categorize the different kinds of execution control. Also: merging it into one document would give me a tendency to use more heading levels and the styling for those is not optimal yet. Not a strong argument maybe, but it does make me think: More heading levels might be 'proof' that a separation in several articles is not a bad thing.
- [x] I just wanted to save some time merging each pair of documents lots of times only to merge them into a larger document again.
- [x] Taking a look at how it looks now.

##### 2020-05-20 Done Merging Parameters Articles Together

- [x] ~~Maybe merge all the Parameters content into one article if it is not too much.~~
- [x] Relatively small:
    - [x] "02.0. Parameter Passing.docx:"
    - [x] "03.0. Joint Display of Access Connectors and Object Relationships.docx"
    - [x] Moved their text to the "Miscellaneous Parameter Topics" article.
- [x] "05.0. Imported Parameter Concepts"
    - [x] Not large topics. Maybe Required & Optional is a bit larger. Half of it or so is idea texts, but not bad ones I think. Basically just the version from the previous version of the documentation (Symbol Language.doc).
    - [x] Merging together seems appropriate.
- [x] "10.0. Miscellaneous Parameter Topics"
    - [x] Also not large articles.
    - [x] Merging together seems appropriate.
- [x] ~~I think I want to merge things together in phases, before I decide whether or not I want to turn it into just one bigger article.~~

##### 2020-05-18 Done Merging Commands Articles Together

- [x] I still mean to rename the docs so the 'in a Diagram suffixes are gone.
- [x] Could not see a pattern in what I would want browsing the first few documents.
- [x] Maybe I want to group the first ones into a Main Concepts article.
- [x] I might want to inspect it some more in search of ideas.
- [x] Main Concepts:
    - [x] I suspect I would like to put the 10 documents Commands.docx until Active Clause.docx in one document.
- [x] Hard to group:
    - [x] Start & Stop.docx until 13.1. Changing Inactive to Executable.docx the articles are sort of medium sized and hard to view as a group together, I think.
- [x] Personal feeling: I think the information rate is too high for me now. Lots of topics rush by my eyes at a large pace and my energy level is dropping.
- [x] Even if I do not know how I could group together many of the articles logically, if I can find a few groups, that would already benefit the overviewability of the topic list.
- [x] ~~These are small:~~
    - [x] ~~"15.0. Command References Inside Commands.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~"16.2. Executables & Executions.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~"17.1. Procedure.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~"18. Resolution When Not Allowed For Commands.docx"~~
    - [x] ~~"22.0.     Sub-Commands Not Manually Started.docx"~~
- [x] "19. Parent Controls Its Sub-Executions.docx":
    - [x] Seems like the 3 articles after it are part of it, but not sure.
- [x] Creation behavior:
    - [x] There seem 8 'Creation Behavior' articles. They might not be small, but grouping them to one article might tidy up. Also, it does not seem to me a topic you always want to see in detail. Maybe look at it once and say "Ok, so that's how that could work." Now the topic is quite prominently present in the article list.
- [x] These seem groupable:
    - [x] "35.2. Inactive Command Object Redirection.docx"
    - [x] "36.1. Inactive Command Class Redirection.docx"
    - [x] "37.2. Executable Command Class Redirection.docx"
    - [x] "38.2. Executable Command Object Redirection.docx"
- [x] These seem groupable:
    - [x] "39.1. Target Command Object.docx"
    - [x] "40.1. Target Command Definition.docx"
    - [x] Or maybe put in Command Redirection.
    - [x] Those two have loose ideas in them.
    - [x] I might not want to stop myself from merging articles that have loose ideas. (My argument against it seems to be: It might get messy.)
    - [x] I also might not want to step away from the 'put loose ideas where they belong'.
    - [x] So maybe I want to accept that some loose ideas get spread a little over the content here and there.
    - [x] The idea with the loose ideas was to go through them at some point seeing if any of it is still usable or not and then maybe discard them, or integrate the ideas into the content. Something like that.
- [x] Out of scope? 42.0. Implementation of System Commands.docx
- [x] Example diagrams:
    - [x] Maybe put them all in one article.
    - [x] ~~Maybe rename and see what they mean.~~
- [x] Some topics' titles look like main concepts to me. I want to evaluate later if I want to move them to Commands Main Concepts.docx.
    - [x] Maybe if ut were'd for the Start and Stop article in between I would just move more to Commands Main Concepts.
    - [x] Consider merging the content of these with into the Commands Main Concepts.docx:
    - [x] "13. Reading & Writing Parameters.docx"
- [x] Merge these two:
    - [x] "17. Command Object Referrers.docx"
    - [x] "18. Command Definition Referrers.docx"

##### 2020-05-18 Done Merging System Objects Articles Together

- [x] Deciding what to do with these, was a bit intense. Especially when I hit a part of the content I have reservations about.
- [x] System Commands:
    - [x] Articles for the various aspects might be merged to one article. Those are like 15 articles or so. Most of them are small. 3 of them are a bit larger.
- [x] System Interfaces:
    - [x] Articles for the various system objects might be put together into one. Not that all of them are small. Just that enough of them are. It seems a bit of a hinder to have to open them one by one. A single article might make browsing the content easier. The amount of articles might be more overwhelming that an article that has some pages.
- [x] Assignment + subtopics
    - [x] May be turned onto 1 article.
- [x] I think the main parts may become more obvious from the article list if I merge together more articles into one.
- [x] System Command Call Notations:
    - [x] 4 smaller, 3 larger
    - [x] Not sure if for the size of them I would merge them together.
    - [x] It is kind of one topic.
- [x] ~~Misc topics at the end:~~
    - [x] ~~Not sure yet if merging is appropriate.~~

##### 2020-05-16 Done Reorganize Encircle Language Spec Files

- [x] The bulk of the content is in the Coding Concepts.
- [x] Diagram Expression content:
    - [x] Is now in more than 1 place.
    - [x] "1. Diagram Expression" folder:
        - [x] Describes Basic Diagram Elements.
        - [x] The argument, that the diagram elements must be quickly introduced at the beginning, I am not sure about that anymore. So not sure if this actually must be at the beginning of the documentation anymore.
    - [x] "6. Expression\1. Diagrams"
        - [x] Seems less finished up. I am not sure I would want to put that at the top of the documentation or at least not in this state.
    - [x] "7. Other Topics\9. Old or Boring\About Programming In General.doc"
        - [x] This is old text, that when rewritten I might even want as the introduction text that the Encircle Language Spec starts with, or maybe just part of it.
        - [x] Is not really a diagram expression topic specifically.
- [x] ~~I might want to somehow merge those diagram topics together.~~
- [x] And put the Coding Concepts sub-folders just in the root.
- [x] In what order will I 'mix' the Coding Concepts and the Diagram Expression topics?
    - [x] Brainstorm: I don't think I want to just start with the Objects chapter. I do like that something starts with the overview. Right now that is the Basic Diagram Elements. Later it may be something else. I think I will keep Basic Diagram Element at the top. Then just the code concepts. Then Other Diagram Expression Topics, just a new folder, a flattened out version of the old.
    - [x] I guess I am just making a flatter list of things and keeping most of the order.
    - [x] 'About Programming In General.doc' 
        - [x] Could be put at the top as the introduction.
        - [x] Actually, just reading it over, I think it may be still to rough of a text, that I want to make a bit more neutral, before making it the main thing to start with.
        - [x] It and other bits of texts from the original Symbol Language.doc may compose a new introduction to the Encircle language after some reformulating.
        - [x] All in all, I think this content is a but rough for putting at the beginning of the documentation.
- [x] There is a clash in index pages. "Code Concepts.doc" and "Language.doc" may need to become one and cleaned up.
- [x] Moving "Language.doc" content to "Code Concepts.doc" in a controlled fashion.
    - [x] There is no heading 'Object Order'.
- [x] I think I am just going to knead the content.
- [x] The folder subdivision is now much simpler.
- [x] "8.Previous Versions" folder:
    - [x] Has the version of the documentation: Symbol Language.doc.
    - [x] Also contains those Symbol Pictures. I do not want to publish all of them.
    - [x] I do not think I want this document in the published material: D:\Source\JJs Software\Software System Docs\1.1. Encircle Language Spec\8. Previous Versions\2004-00-00 XX    Symbol Language\Other Files\Coding.txt.
    - [x] Or rather, this has some content in it, that I find questionable.
    - [x] I see two zips with pictures.
    - [x] How do I handle this? In the future I want to go list out all files in the history and remove things from the history that I do not want to publish. Those zips might become one of those files.
    - [x] But when I clean up the current state, will I find all the files back that I want to remove from history? Some have obvious file names. So I guess I will.
    - [x] I question whether I even want to include those example diagrams. Or whether I want to include them in this state.
    - [x] Or maybe I will need them for a better quality referenced image? Nah, I doubt it. That seems too much work, to replace the images in the docs with possibly better images from that zip.
    - [x] It might also not be useful to readers, at least not all of it, because it is just bulky. No one might want to go through them I think.
    - [x] Perhaps a selection of it might be useful. 
    - [x] The argument 'Too interesting too throw away'. I might not agree with that anymore.
    - [x] I think most of them are also present somewhere in the documentation.
    - [x] Some of them I want to not have in source control history.
    - [x] Some I might want to keep.
    - [x] If those 2 zips with pictures are the same...
    - [x] I just compared file sizes and they are different. So the zips might not be the same.
    - [x] I could unpack and compare.
    - [x] I think if they are comparable or one is preferred over another, I could remove the other.
    - [x] I could strip one of the copies.
    - [x] Leave that one in the new documentation.
    - [x] So do I remove the one from the 'Previous Version' documentation?
    - [x] For versioning like that, I think it would have made sense to keep the one in the 'Previous Version' documentation.
    - [x] But for control over the content, that I publish, in this case I would really like one copy.
    - [x] Result of diff: 2x Thumbs.db. 4x a file that is not in 'Previous Version', but is in 'Other Diagram Topics\Example Diagrams'
    - [x] Then do I want to remove the one in 'Previous Versions'?
    - [x] I am not sure I want to unzip them first and then commit. Maybe I want to clear it out first after I unzip it, before I commit it. That might make cleaning up later easier.
    - [x] I tried to revert my commit, but it leaves behind files in my working folder.
    - [x] Reason for deleting picture: Don't want it in there.
    - [x] Reason for deleting picture: Is already visible in a document.
    - [x] Reason for deleting picture: It has private info seen right through the paper.
    - [x] Some of them I have a hard time saying goodbye to.
    - [x] I am beginning to think I might just want to remove all of them.
    - [x] Or most of them.
    - [x] The scanned ones probably.
    - [x] The ones certainly used in documentation or otherwise discardable.
    - [x] I think I would remove most of them, and only keep a couple.
    - [x] Oh, I am done.

##### 2020-04-01 Done Encircle Language Spec Planning Docs

- [x] Empty project folders:
    - [x] I could evaluate whether those empty planning docs folders are needed.
    - [x] To me it seems odd now, that 'Errors' is put out of scope.
    - [x] I think I want to move the topics 'Errors' and 'Concept Construct' from the Out-of-Scope document to the Encircle Language Spec Planning docs.
    - [x] The 'Out-of-Scope' document os currently not just postponed items of the Encircle Language Spec, but more than that: not even considered part of the Encircle Language Spec project at all anymore.
    - [x] It is still not a hard rule to be set. But putting Errors and Concepts out of view, makes it sort of not the same project for the sake of Concepts and putting my head into the sand when it is about Errors. If I have ideas about these things, they do belong in the project I think. I have a hard time thinking them away.
- [x] Formatting:
    - [x] Phase-by-phase.
        - [x] Background black.
        - [x] Name spelling JJ van Zon.
        - [x] No abbreviations in folder name and file name.
        - [x] Rename 'Document' to 'Spec'?
        - [x] Suffix with 'Plan'.
        - [x] Do the above for the Current and Future Projects
        - [x] 'Project' => 'Plan'
        - [x] Leave out the word 'Plan' if obvious.
        - [x] Headings 'Encircle Language Spec' + similar to folder and file name.
        - [x] 'Computer Language' => 'Encircle Language'
        - [x] 'Articles' => 'Spec'
        - [x] No sub folders, just files?
            - [x] Some sub-projects contain many files.
            - [x] Flattening it out might make a big list.
            - [x] Keeping some folders but have other as loose files, makes you lose that time-line feeling.
            - [x] Too much doubt -> Postpone.
        - [x] Maybe prefix all with Encircle Language Spec Plan. Then simplify the rest of the title, because Plan is already implied.
            - [x] Getting path length problems. Collapsing sub-folders with only one file after all.
        - [x] Not sure if that prefixing looks so great.
            - [x] It looks cluttered. And I cannot apply it consistently, because of path length problems. Branch. Try without prefixes.
            - [x] 'Spec Plan' somewhere in there looked ok.
            - [x] My doubts are that if this doc is in the internet, the title means a lot, so why not have it be complete? It does already have that completeness somewhere in the URL, but...
            - [x] Maybe let go of the toilet role principle and just call something 'Automatic Containment for Relationships.doc'. Not 'Plan', not 'Spec' just lazy. Maybe it is ok.
            - [x] My being better at systematics than words might be in the way. So that I don't easily decide what's clear enough.
        - [x] Convert to docx without Compatibility Mode.
            - [x] What use is that, if I want to convert it to MD instead?
            - [x] Conversion to MD is not great if I use color coding it the docs.
        - [x] Remove '& Copyright'
            - [x] > Only found 1 occurrence: 'Encircle Language Spec Ideas'.
        - [x] Remove unnecessary title page white space and 'version XXXX-XX' mentioning.
        - [x] Make main heading and such not take up so much space.
        - [x] Month in the headings, so it is clear that the fact that it is a time period is leading.
            - [x] In the front or the back of the sub-project name?
            - [x] In the file names too in case they have a folder?
            - [x] ~~Months in headings: not entirely convinced about the difference of the order where the month ends up between 'Project Plans' and 'Project Summaries'.~~
        - [x] 'TODO' => 'Notes'? > Cannot find it.
        - [x] Set proofing language to English US. > I don't see the problem anymore. Maybe the conversion to docx fixed it.
        - [x] First pages layout
        - [x] Page header and footer
            - [x] I am good with no page headers and footers.
        - [x] File properties (author and such)
            - [x] If they are odd. Not that odd => Leave it there.
            - [x] Still have to do Done projects.
        - [x] Update lists of contents
        - [x] Legend:
            - [x] Brainstorm: I might keep the legend as it is. It may be more work to check which colors are used where and to change it? Maybe not, maybe that would be the right way to go.
            - [x] 'Legend' => 'Legend of Symbols and Markings'?
            - [x] Use simpler color coding.
            - [x] There is ambiguity between coloring of back then and now.
                - [x] Brown meant I think postponed (indefinitely). Some share of brown even meant 'part done, part postponed'. Now brown means do not do. (And part done, part postponed is orange.)
                - [x] Light grey used to mean do not do. Now it means done.
            - [x] Normalize the legends.
            - [x] Make it 1 central document
            - [x] This document has a legend right inside it: Concepts as External Modules Spec Goal (2008-05) (postponed).docx
        - [x] Font Calibri
            - [x] Just the normal font, not the headings.
        - [x] ~~Headings do not have colors.~~
            - [x] ~~Are not going to work for me anyway, with the low brightness on my screen.~~
            - [x] ~~It starts being not so functional anymore, the changes.~~
- [x] I somehow don't trust this is all there's to it about Encircle Language Spec planning docs. Look over the state of it. It *would* be fun to move on to a next topic and have something finished. But somehow I don't believe it. > It is. I lean towards the actual language spec rather than the planning, now.

##### 2020-03-22 Done Organize Planning Docs

- [x] I moved around folders, for a preliminary split up between Encircle Docs and Circle 3 Programming projects.
- [x] I could change titles of projects inside the doc content too.
    - [x] I am unsure whether I want to call the projects 'Encircle Docs'. Maybe 'Encircle Language Specification'.
    - [x] I do want to go for the name 'Encircle' as opposed to 'New Computer Language'.
        - [x] I don't mind that this makes my documentation stick to a name that in theory might later change. It probably will not change at all.
    - [x] But Encircle Docs is too general, I think. It should be Encircle Language Specification.
    - [x] I don't care for the abbreviation 'Spec'. I am not a fan of abbreviation and I don’t think it makes it much more concise or clear.
    - [x] Also: I am hitting my limit here. I'm tired and getting all sorts of symptoms.
    - [x] Encircle Language Design is also an option. 'Specification' may raise expectations about finishedness.
    - [x] Encircle Language Design Planning
    - [x] Encircle Language Specification
    - [x] 'Specification': suggests finishedness, but does it? CSS is all sorts unfinished modules.
    - [x] Leaving out 'Specification' or 'Design': Makes distinction with Circle 3 Programming hard to see.
    - [x] The word 'Encircle' should be in it.
    - [x] The word 'Language' at least sheds light a bit on what it actually is.
    - [x] But Encircle Language Specification Plan is just a long name.
    - [x] But 'New Computer Language Functional Design' was too, so that is not an argument?
    - [x] 'Spec': Is an abbreviation. I generally dislike those, but I think in this case it is appropriate. It is adopted as a word by the community.
- [x] I could evaluate whether those empty planning docs folders are needed.
    - [x] The 'update ... articles' sub-projects
        - [x] Defined as empty project doc folders: I see some of it back in the Encircle Language Spec's Strategy doc, Project Steps and Time Planning, but not in the Products doc. Some redo's are defined, be it not in Products doc. It seems the reason for redoing is not always stated. I think I should make the list complete in all the planning docs where appropriate. Then I can get rid of the remaining empty sub-project folders.
        - [x] Mentioned them in the Products doc now.
        - [x] Removed the empty project doc folders.
        - [x] Look at Encircle Language Spec Strategy for things to put in Encircle Language Spec Products.
        - [x] Look at Encircle Language Spec Project Steps & Time Planning for things to put in Encircle Language Spec Products.
            - [x] There is a lot there that specifies the reasons to change the articles.
        - [x] Consider that some elaborations in the Encircle Language Spec Products document might belong elsewhere.
            - [x] Do they belong in Encircle Language Spec Strategy?
            - [x] Sort of collides with the Sub-Project folders idea. Maybe details belong in a sub-project folder and a general reference to it in the strategy doc.
            - [x] Maybe go the other way: put sub-projects strategy in the main strategy doc and get rid of separate sub-projects. (My gut says: no, keep sub-project descriptions. That's what they are for: elaboration on a sub-project's scope.)
            - [x] Decision: Rule: Any elaboration now in the Products planning doc, belongs in a sub-project document.
- [x] Sub-Projects:
    - [x] The documents could probably be shorter. Lots of those Project Summaries are not so useful template texts, not filled in. The notes at the bottom would do.
    - [x] Then it is basically just loose ideas, that might have been given a too prominent place. Maybe put it elsewhere, if it is just unhelpful for visual overview, perhaps. > Some are more than that. I keep em this way.
- [x] I like that I seem to build tolerance (back) for not exactly knowing where I am going with it, gradually shaping it, and just taking my time to make things more overviewable, regardless of whether someone might think it is time well spent or not. I myself just create more overview and understanding of the material that way.

### Planning | in General

#### Done

##### 2020-05-27 Done Brainstorm Priorities

- [x] I am not sure how to approach things right now.
- [x] ~~I could also try and pick a design issue from the list 'Language Design / Content Changes' above.~~
- [x] ~~I feel somehow I had more plans, but I forgot about them.~~
- [x] ~~Maybe there are few main problems I would like to highlight.~~
- [x] ~~Somehow I tend to want to just start at the top and start reformulating.~~
- [x] I guess I am not sure where to start.
- [x] And I am also still a little surprised that I am at this stage. I feel I must have forgotten something that must be left to do, before I can do this.
- [x] ~~I think maybe heavy redesign is off the table for now, because I estimate that would be too intense for now.~~
- [x] I also have in mind marking work as postponed for 'Encircle Broader View' and 'Encircle Construct Drafts', cleaning up the brainstorms that covert those + Encircle Language Spec. That way I might create overview over the TODO notes.
- [x] The feeling I forgot something, feels like it could be in the texts below, but the texts below seem to be too rough and unstructured to give me that insight and overview. If it were more structured and overviewable, and done stuff marked as done, postponed stuff marked as such and split into coherent chunks. I think I would like that.
- [x] So structure the TODO and Postponed things about Encircle Language Spec Revamp notes, might be what I want to do first.

##### 2019-08-05 Done Writing Style Mixed Issues

- [x] ~~The work might be modularized. I am not attracted to how CSS3 is modularized, each piece of specs with a different state of being finished up. It seems messy. But I can employ the same organization to accept certain concepts are just more crystalized out than others, making it easier to share, even in an unfinished state, and stimulating keeping things separated and separately usable even when other parts are just really still messy. > Scoped things more sharply instead, so more is finished up better percentually.~~
- [x] ~~I took a look at some of the postponed work. I worry about the messiness of the content. And if the loose ends will make the idea fall apart. And whether this makes it even fit for publishing. I just don't know. But I think I should come back to it later. Because I had strategies for this. And I might be too hard on myself. A clear 'flag' [Preliminary documentation] in red somewhere at the top usually does the trick. Might tell people clearly not to expect too much from the text that follows. Just being clear about that might be enough.~~

##### 2020-05-24 Done Notes Planning

- [x] Maybe merge more article together in the first chapters.
- [x] Maybe list out main language design issues.
- [x] ~~Some work in Future Sub-Projects may already be done.~~
    - [x] ~~> Applies to the TODO item 'Merge conceptual explanation with diagram explanation'. Those 2 things may now be put into the same article, but the explanations are still often 2 explanations instead of one. So I do not think I can call it done.~~

##### 2020-05-10 Done Brainstorm Effort

It may not be within my capacity to do some of the things I plan to do. Thinking critically about word usage and whether I am stating things too strictly... I feel this might not correspond with my energy budget. I made a careful conclusion about that before. Publishing might be more important, than if I might come off too strongly in the text. It feels like this effort is pulling me down more than I might be able to handle. It seems to be weighing on me.

Perhaps I can drop the goal of trying to use a different language style. My next goal was scoping. I seem to still be bargaining with the idea, like: "Maybe I can just reformulate when it *really* seems to harsh." I think maybe that won't work. Because I tend to evaluate the harshness, and this evaluation is 'jittery': sometimes it seems to be 'on', sometimes 'off', sometimes too on tightly, sometimes maybe too weakly. Perhaps I am better off dropping the whole goal of rewording it. I like learning to use language with more air in it, for my personal life for communication to others, or to prevent holding on too tightly to an idea. But this hobby project may need some air in it. Paradoxically, by not loosening up the language. I feel that writing new texts, I already seem to adopt a ligher way of conveying ideas. Evaluating existing texts seems harder.

I think I lean towards the decision of dropping the goal of reformulating texts to be more 'open'. I still have to get used to the idea.

Little reformulations here and there is something I do when reading over and editing my own texts. Some wording changes I might want to be tolerant towards. But the anxiousness might be something I want to let go of.

I feel like I recognize a personality in my own texts, that I adopted to hopefully be taken more seriously. I feel I am on a different wavelength now, or that I want to be.

So with that new perspective on the work, I was done and satisfied with the last page of the text I was working on within like a minute. Perhaps now I can focus more on what I actually chose to do: scope the project some more.

##### 2020-05-08 Done Brainstorm Priorities

- [x] Rewording the Done projects is getting a bit boring.
- [x] ~~Maybe wrap up Parameters planning doc.~~
- [x] Scoping was an alternative thing to focus on.
- [x] ~~Something else could be actually digging into the Encircle Language Spec docs themselves.~~
- [x] I think scoping is a better choice for now.
- [x] I want to go over the Encircle Language Spec Plan documents, moving things out of scope off the top of my head.
- [x] Side-goal: I read nicer docs, giving my head a bit of a break.
- [x] I think I will mark things with red before actually moving content out.
- [x] Still lots of definites in the wording of the main planning docs.
- [x] I do like too see it reworded it to nothing being a strict rule anymore and you can always make up your own mind. It seems this does not harm the integrity of the idea.

##### 2020-03-15 Done Planning

I read over notes to know where I was, and mark some things of as 'done'.

This was too intense. I wonder if starting to change documentation will be too intense too or if I should stop now. Or if other activities or non-activities will be even more intense. I choose to stop for a while now. After a little over 20 minutes.

#### Postponed

##### 2020-06-01 Postponed Checklist Tone Change

- [ ] ~ (More helpers are in my personal development notes, not here, sorry.)
- [ ] ~ Marking trigger words in red.
- [ ] ~ Possibly mark questionable trigger words with a star (*) too.
- [ ] ~ Finding replacement words, possibly using online thesaurus.
- [ ] ~ Vary natural language grammar constructs?
- [ ] ~ Going over the document again to reformulate.

##### 2020-04-18 Postponed Brainstorm Writing Style

- [ ] ~ The aim is to use less definite, more open language.
- [ ] ~ (I can view ideas on how in my personal development notes, not here, sorry.)
- [ ] ~ Also check: whether the stories make sense.
- [ ] ~ And whether the content is still in scope.
- [ ] ~ Remove links, since they break so easily.
- [ ] ~ Casual mentionings of article titles are also fragile. They break quite easily.
- [ ] ~ That seems quite a lot to check. Maybe that is why it is not easy.

##### 2020-05-27 Postponed Checklist Reformulating Chapters

- [x] Done projects:
    - [x] The postponed reformulation of the done projects is on my mind.
- [x] New Intro:
    - [x] But that makes me think: I want to give it a new beginning in the first place: use some of the old Symbol Language documentation and reformulate a gentler intro.
- [ ] ~ Reformulating:
    - [ ] ~ More open, less resolute language
    - [ ] ~ I could start reading and reformulating top to bottom.
    - [ ] ~ Introduction
        - [ ]  Applying trigger word marking technique to this already reworded document?
    - [ ] ~ For topics TODO / Done: See *Encircle Language Spec Product List*.

##### 2019-08-05 Postponed Mixed Writing Style Issues

- [ ] ~ The read uses terminology in a very specific way, that is not shared with my peers, therefor not easing readers into the material.
- [ ] ~ Rename the term 'Code Base' to something like 'Base Code' or 'Base of the Code'.
- [ ] ~ I seem to have had several goals fighting over each other, in projects done long ago about this documentation:
    - [ ] ~ Explaining it to myself.
    - [ ] ~ Designing the concepts, separately from the notation.
    - [ ] ~ Tying together loose ends.
    - [ ] ~ Making it easy to read for someone else.

##### 2019-08-27 Postponed Simpler Rules

- [ ] ~ I think the 'being blunt' might help. It is not blunt unfriendly, because the explanations might become so much simpler if you say: this is that, this is that, instead of and this far-fetched edge case is solved in this difficult, abstract, theoretical, but precisely determined way, that I'm not sure I even understand anymore... : )

#### Done

##### 2020-06-18 Done Brainstorm Reconsidering Writing Style

I seem to not like it when I make the rules for reformulating things so strict. It is sort of paradoxical too. The text produced is supposed to be not as strict, but the rule for making the text not strict, is strict.

It was supposed to feel like hobby.

I think I would like to change the rules by which I was reformulating these texts.  
I think I want to be more ok with words that seem to exaggerate or be quite strong. For instance "distinct", ''rule", "defined". Maybe I want to keep those words in there.  
I think I am noticing that many words just are black and white. If I use a thesaurus I get to see words that might also be quite strong.  
Maybe I can leave it with adding maybe's and perhapses and leave words that seem to express it strongly, in there.

Reasons for changing the way to do it might be:

- It seems to make me anxious being hyper aware of these 'forbidden' words.
- The text seems to now lack flair, and might not grab attention as well anymore.
- I feel I use more in between words, that carry not much meaning. It seems wordier than necessary.

I used to aim to be concise. In doing so, some thing might start to seem a bit commanding or something. But I did do my best then to make the text clear. Maybe this is not such a bad thing and maybe I was not doing that badly at it after all. Maybe just adding some wiggle words is enough, so that I might form an intermediate writing style. Perhaps that will be concise, strong, but leaving room for other options.

I would like to feel comfortable writing again. I would like to not do it 'wrong' like before, if that was even wrong.

##### 2020-05-31 Done Wiggle Word Difficulty

- [x] A less pleasant experience yesterday with the trigger word marking.
- [x] Still the problem that formulations not necessarily come naturally to me.
- [x] I liked describing a system of trigger words.
- [x] I also kind of liked picking them out, marking them red.
- [x] But trying to find alternate formulations for them, was tricky.
- [x] One thing that seems to bother me, is that I do not see that a rule is too fixated, until I have formulated it in a more open sense and sensed that it is feels closer to the truth. But I do not seem to read a resolute sentence and realize it could use wiggle room. I mostly just see a valid rule, not one too harshly stated.
- [x] Another aspect to consider is that formulating new sentences quite automatically I insert the wiggle words, probably because I did train myself a bit to use them more. But seeing the problem in existing texts is harder somehow.
- [x] I would like that after marking trigger words in red, it would be a matter of arbitrarily inserting wiggle words, removing adjectives or changing definite verbs to more polite ones.
- [x] But I end up scratching my head trying to find a way to reformulate something. Difficulty to find the 'nicest' alternate word, or sometimes even to realize something is even wrong with the trigger word I marked in red.
- [x] Sometimes my brain says: nothing is wrong with trigger word, but when I replaced it with difficulty, I realize the trigger word did seemed to be 'wrong' after all, and realize that things are not necessarily that black and white.
- [x] But my mind, that is reading and understanding these existing sentences does not sense anything wrong with them really, so has difficulty finding a proper way to change it, or even a reason. It's it like my mind resists changing the sentence, because at first I fail to see why.
- [x] An additional problem seems to be that I have very little energy. This computer hobby usually takes little energy. I am built that way. But certain things about it do take energy. This task seems to tap into something my mind does not automatically do naturally or easily. Not sure why. It just takes too much effort.
- [x] I kept re-evaluating the sentence as rewritten: whether it 'walked' well, whether it still made sense, whether the wording is varied enough in the document as a whole. That might be a lot of language processing for me right now.
- [x] So after this reflection I am left with a question: How to proceed?
- [x] Alternative: I am not sure, but could I proceed the same way, and just hope I will have more energy now?
- [x] Alternative: It may need focus to try and insert wiggle words sort of 'robotically', maybe not even looking at the meaning of the sentences.
- [x] > One alternative seems to need energy. The other altenative seems to need focus. Neither is aplenty.
- [x] Alternative: Build up more wiggle word dictionary. May be hard, because thinking of alternate words seems energy draining.
- [x] Limitation: That the document I work on now goes from one topic to the next, might not help me.
- [x] Limitation: Switching between the chapter content and the overview content is probably difficult switching for me.
- [x] Limitation: Doing it in a way to avoid where my problems are, requires focus, which seems to be a problem in itself.
- [x] Limitation: I think maybe language processing is problematic for me right now.
- [x] Alternative: Using the existing wiggle word dictionary, inserting wiggle words robotically. No careful evaluation.
- [x] I do estimate that the above should be the kind of thing I used to be good at. But focus was the problem yesterday. Could not hold myself to a plan anymore yesterday, I guess. Maybe I can today.
- [x] Helper: Putting up a Post It: "Insert wiggle words robotically", for focus.
- [x] Helper: Keeping the wiggle room dictionary closed? (prevent switching)
- [x] Helper: Use thesaurus.com for words.
- [x] One problem I see with 'insert wiggle words robotically', is that inserting wiggle words was not my only goal editing this documentation. Maybe I can make wiggle words one phase and reformulation a second phase, and not do it in one blow, because it seems to make it more difficult. I just do not want to forget that I also want to make the text better content-wise, not just change the tone.
- [x] While doing it:
    - [x] Accept limited word variation at first?
    - [x] Yes, when I cannot find a word, it is hard on me.
    - [x] Sometimes a text might be deprecated. Saves some reformulation, but may personally mean more information processing > more easily tired.

##### 2020-04-18 Done Brainstorm Writing Style

- [x] ~~It kind of bothers me that the story starts in the middle. Where are the other sub-project descriptions? Maybe mixed with other big projects, like 'Software System Documentation'. Maybe.~~
- [x] Brainstorm: I worry a lot if the words come off too strongly. On top of that I am not in a very subtle mood right now. If I was feeling more calm and friendly, I might have better judgement about it. Maybe I cannot do this right now. I can only judge language constructions, not whether it feels right. When my base line mood would be calm and friendly, I can just feel whether the words bump with that or not. That might be easier. Sometimes just using calmer language, makes me calmer, but right now it does not seem to be working.
- [x] Wording:
    - [x] Is it really such a problem, that I talk in definites about steps taken and rules of the systematics as I try to work them out? Maybe in talk like that, still add a 'might'. Imagine what if you would not explain to yourself, but to someone else that has to work it out further. Imagine what it would feel like if someone else read it. Like you're being dictated rules, perhaps.
    - [x] After that I might want to change command-like sentences and rule-like statements, to just add 'might' to it or other wiggle words. I would talk to myself that way, just maybe comes off harsh. Maybe being less strict towards myself is also not a bad idea.
    - [x] Added maybe's.
    - [x] Perhaps after that a reformulation phase. I tend to come up with nicer flowing alternatives to just the word 'maybe'.
- [x] Brainstorm wording:
    - [x] Maybe I go a different direction with this.
    - [x] With my gut I might assess whether the language is too blunt or not.
    - [x] Maybe if it just list things, that actually happened, then it might not be much of a problem.
    - [x] Definite language to create a pseudo-truth for a false sense of control, might be a problem.
    - [x] Things stated as rules, that are not hard rules might be a problem.
    - [x] When setting rules to follow a plan, wiggle words might be helpful.
    - [x] Black and white opinion about something that may or may not be true, might be a problem.
    - [x] In some sentences it seems more obvious. If they sound opinionated and black-and-white.
    - [x] Maybe I am looking for clues in texts where there are none. Sort of like when I am driving and see no other traffic, I am scared that there may be traffic, that I am not seeing.
    - [x] Words like 'annoying' or 'constantly' trigger more easily. Stating something as definite, without 'maybe's seems a more subtle 'problem'.

##### 2008-08-31 Done Writing Style Ideas

Encircle Language Spec, Writing Style,  
2008-08-31

Sometimes it is just clearer to have an article, with diagrams in it straight away, without any article with just textual explanations. In the future, the whole form of the documentation might change as such and have diagram expression be more present in the conceptual explanations.

### Search Tools

#### 2020-04-09 Done Explore (Content) Search Options

- [x] Exp: Visual Studio Find in Files
- [x] Obs~ Some paths are too long...
- [x] The file had a path of 260, which I think is the max for Windows 7, but some API's use 255 as a max.
- [x] Exp: Shorten to 255. Find in Files again
- [x] Obs~ Error is gone.
- [x] Exp: Get rid of an intermediate folder to shorten the path and still keep descriptive names.
- [x] Obs~ Visual Studio Find in Files will not search doc contents.
- [x] Hyp:    Windows 7 File Explorer will not find whole words. For some things that's relevant for other things it is not. (I thought I saw it).
- [x] Exp: search "*.doc"
- [x] Obs: Now it does not match "*.docx".
- [x] Hyp: I thought I saw that some times.
- [x] Exp: Windows 7 File Explorer. "D:\Source\JJs Software\Project Docs\Encircle Language Spec Plan". Search "content:Joost".
- [x] Obs~ It shows 2 files, if I open them (docx's) and search for Joost in Microsoft Word, I get no result. Odd.
- [x] Hyp: File properties?

### Main Planning Docs | Content Changes

#### 2020-04-15 Done Encircle Language Spec Planning Docs

- [x] I finished 'Encircle Language Spec Strategy'.
- [x] 'Encircle Language Spec Product List' seems finished.
- [x] The word 'Legacy' is in there, which I tried to avoid.
    - [x] Integration was not the best word, it seemed.
    - [x] 'Inherited' is too ambiguous a term.
    - [x] It is because other languages have those concepts?
    - [x] Oh, wait, it is my own subdivision.
    - [x] Maybe the word Legacy is ok there, because there is only the danger of putting down my own work, not others'.
    - [x] It seems like it could be both.
    - [x] 'Existing' is a little ambiguous too.
    - [x] Why was integrate such a bad word according to my brother?
    - [x] Synonyms?
    - [x] I am going for 'integrate'.
- [x] 'Encircle Language Spec Steps & Time Planning' should be next.
    - [x] Yeah, has definite language, that might need more wiggle room.
    - [x] Sometimes I don't even notice it, because I am so used to try and gain a sense of control over the situation, that I just speak in definites.
    - [x] Resolute language is solved.
    - [x] 'Overview for Progress Monitoring' is not the same list as the scored and prioritized work items above it.
    - [x] Why is there even a separate list for 'Progress Monitoring'? It seems handy for quick overview, but why is the main list not quickly giving that overview then? Improve the main list instead and remove the 'Overview for Progress Monitoring'? Because it might just not be handy to have two things.
    - [x] Inheritance is already finished.
        - [x] Do I update that now? Or do I see that as replanning that should be done later? Don't know. It just looks inconsistent this way.
- [x] Done Encircle Language Spec Ideas.
    - [x] The wording is in rougher format, but it is not very long, so should be doable.
    - [x] It may have out-of-scope content.
    - [x] Maybe read over again. Second time around it still seems kind of resolute.
