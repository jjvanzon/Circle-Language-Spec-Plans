- Study design patterns
I have already given some design patterns a very central place in the language.
Before I even knew the pattern already existed, I had worked out the multimethod pattern all on my own, in detail including the embeddance of the concept in a programming language.
I should know all design patterns. This may save me the trouble of coming up with them on my own. It may prevent me from first making mistakes in my design, to use the knowledge others have already aquired.
