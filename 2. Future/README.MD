Encircle Language Spec Plans | Future
=====================================

What might be done in the future.

- [Tone Change](Tone%20Change)

    - There may be a desire to change the tone of the documentation to milder language. Details might be found in these sub-project documents.

- [Content Changes](Content%20Changes)

    - These topics might already be in the spec, but specific changes might be desired. Those desired changes, may be found in these sub-project descriptions.

- [Language Design](Language%20Design)

    - These are constructs that might be desired and may hardly have a description in the spec yet.
    - Or topics that may be more significant changes to the language.
