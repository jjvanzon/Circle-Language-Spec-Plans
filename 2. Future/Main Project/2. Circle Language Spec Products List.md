## **Purpose of this Document**
This document is mostly a raw list of the products that can be produced within the project *Circle Language Spec*. The goal and strategy were already described in detail in another document, called *Circle Language Spec Strategy.*
## **Topics Roughly**
### ***Topics To Cover***
Things desirable for the new programming language:

\- Coding Concepts

\- Diagrams
### ***Expression***
Also covered, would be the basics of how you could express yourself in the new language:

\- Diagram Expression
## **Topic List Detailed**
Roughly ordered by level of difficulty (roughly equal to the priority). This list is quite large, because of the split up into tiny little topics. You may find a lack of explanations here. If there were an explanation of a topic, you might find it in the actual Circle Language Spec. If it is not there, that might mean, there simply is no explanation yet.
### ***TODO***
#### **Coding Essentials**
After the phase described below, the aim is that the coding concepts might form a complete OO language.
##### ***Coding Concepts***
###### **Object Resolution**
\- Object Resolution

#### **Automatic Diagram Organization**
At this point the coding concepts may be complete, but without the diagrams being organized automatically, the effectivity of the language might be more limited.
##### ***Diagrams***
