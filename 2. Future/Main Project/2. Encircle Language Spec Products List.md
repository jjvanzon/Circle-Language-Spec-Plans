Circle Language Spec | Product List
===================================

Purpose of this Document
------------------------

This document is mostly a raw list of the products that can be produced within the project *Circle Language Spec*. The goal and strategy were already described in detail in another document, called *Circle Language Spec Strategy.*


Topics Roughly
--------------

### Topics To Cover

Things desirable for the new programming language:

- Coding Concepts
- Diagrams

### Expression

Also covered, would be the basics of how you could express yourself in the new language:

- Diagram Expression


Topic List Detailed
-------------------

Roughly ordered by level of difficulty (roughly equal to the priority). This list is quite large, because of the split up into tiny little topics. You may find a lack of explanations here. If there were an explanation of a topic, you might find it in the actual Circle Language Spec. If it is not there, that might mean, there simply is no explanation yet.

### TODO

#### Coding Essentials

After the phase described below, the aim is that the coding concepts might form a complete OO language.

##### Coding Concepts

- ###### Object Resolution

#### Evaluate

This may be a crossroads at which you might switch to releasing it into the world.  
The language might be able to do without anything put here below.
