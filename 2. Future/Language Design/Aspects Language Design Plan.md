### 2020-01-13 Do Not Do: Brainstorm Aspects / Concepts

'Concepts' are almost exactly like 'aspects' from 'aspect oriented programming', except maybe the idea of whether just about everything can be elevated to become an 'aspect' even things that aren't the aspect oriented programming construct. Even hand-written, coded out aspects, such as those System Aspects in the New Computer Language. Cross-cutting concerns that you couldn't isolate out of the system using an aspect, but are still clearly an aspect from a conceptual point of view. Can new programming constructs be found, that can do that, isolate concerns like that? It is hard to express my ideas about it and explain them well. I don't even have it all clearly in my mind myself yet. Also the comparison requires I know all the details about aspect oriented programming, which I don't.
