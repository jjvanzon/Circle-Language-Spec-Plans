Diagram Metrics | Content Changes
---------------------------------

This document contains some loose ideas about diagram metrics. Or 'automatic diagram organization'.

If the diagrams were to be organized automatically, this may increase the effectivity of the language.

The thing is: when diagrams do not organize themselves automatically (for instance positioning of the shapes and curving of the lines), the effectivity of the language might be reduced, possibly to a point that the intentions with the language might not be reached as much. If the diagrams would organize themselves automatically, the usability of the language might increase.

That means positioning the shapes automatically for instance. Specifically excluded, are the ideas about Automatic Containment. That idea got a little side-tracked, because it's complex and has loose ends.

Part of it, could be documenting ideas about diagram metrics that are only in my head and ones derived from a prototype the of diagram drawing engine that was made.

Topics are e.g.:

- Curved lines
- Bundling of lines

The need to display large amounts of items came to light there, plus that something should be done about it.
Also the need for line bundling became more apparent.

Other topics:

- Inward references
- Access marks (when to show them, when not to show them...)
- Lines exiting the diagram

More topics:

- Spiraling
- Force-Based Ordering
- Object Order Metrics
- Simplification Slider
