Large Lists Problem | Language Design

### 2019-08-05 Postponed Large Lists Problem

- [ ] ~ One point of failure I see in this computer language, is that it works well when there are a limited number of symbols, but as lists get big, the language seems to lose its effectivity. One way to still make it useful, is perhaps to filter, or only partially display lists in the diagrams, just like a normal grid or list would. There was a prototype app that would generate diagrams out of vast sources of symbols. The problem became apparent there and it has been in the back of my head since then.

The 'large lists' problem in Encircle also applies to large lists of commands, that might apply to an object.  
Also that UI's are often optimized to show the most relevant options and then I (with poor judgement?) just say: no none of that, everything only.  
Maybe it's just that this UI will have its place along side other techniques.  
It's just that the large lists problem should be solved in my view.  
Maybe permanent filtering and reordering, which is often hard to customize in windows programs. Like a menu customizer.  
Try to make it easier to do that. Construct your own limited view.
