Diagram Metrics | Content Changes
---------------------------------

This document contains some loose ideas about diagram metrics. That means positioning the shapes automatically for instance. Specifically excluded, are the ideas about Automatic Containment. Those ideas got a little side-tracked, because it's complex and has loose ends.

Part of it, could be documenting ideas about diagram metrics that are only in my head and ones derived from a prototype the of diagram drawing engine that was made.

Topics are e.g.:

- Curved lines
- Bundling of lines

The need to display large amounts of items came to light there, plus that something should be done about it.
Also the need for line bundling became more apparent.

Other topics:

- Inward references
- Access marks (when to show them, when not to show them...)
- Lines exiting the diagram
