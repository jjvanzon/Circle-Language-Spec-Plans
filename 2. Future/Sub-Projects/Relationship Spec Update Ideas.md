Circle Language Spec Plan, Relationships Spec Update Ideas
======================================================

- Relationship Direction
- Relationships with Pointers

- Relationships articles might need an update considering that the notation(s) for static might change things.
- Perhaps merge conceptual explanation and diagram notation.
	- The split up into a conceptual explanation and then separately an article for the diagram notation, might have been easy for writing the docs, but could be merged into a single article again for readability.
- Perhaps change the notation for a bidirectional relationship.
- Do relationships make sense anymore, when related classes are not necessarly fixed by the class?
	- > Seems this is just the distinction between relationships between classes and relationships between objects. The two classes might be not related if the relationship is not defined in the class, but you may still relate an object of certain a class to another object.

The readability of these articles might be questioned. See 'Redo Easy Themes' in the document Circle Language Spec Strategy.

Maybe change the term 'relation' to 'relationship'. That is the term commonly used for it in IT.
