Encircle Language Spec Plans
============================

Static Spec | Content Changes
-----------------------------

The concept of Static could be worked out.

There seem to be competing ideas about static in this project: expressing an original language's intent with the word 'static' (e.g. C#) and, on the other hand, a more generalized concept of static, that anything about a class that remains unchangeable during or after instantiation, is static. (Including method definitions, static variables.) What happens when you use dashed lines to express anything 'static'? This while dashed lines conceptually also stand for 'class'. Do the concepts of static and class merge naturally, or how would that look in practice? This is fruit for thought for updating the descriptions of Static and Classes. 'Static' might not even get a separate description.

Note that the Static article may be buried in the Classes folder in the Encircle Language Spec.

"Static Broader View Idea.md" may elaborate, though those ideas are out of scope for now.
