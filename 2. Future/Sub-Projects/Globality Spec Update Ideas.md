Circle Language Spec Plans | Globality Spec Update Ideas
========================================================

Not sure if this will have to change. Maybe change the term 'Globality' to 'Modules' instead to prevent introducing alienating terminology.

Perhaps shed light on which constructs from other language could be represented as a module in the Circle language, like namespaces, sites, libraries (and even protocol boundaries?).
