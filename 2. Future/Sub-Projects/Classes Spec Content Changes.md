Encircle Language Spec Plans
============================

Classes Spec | Content Changes
------------------------------

- Classes articles might need an update considering that the notation(s) for static might change things.
- The readability of the Classes articles was questionable, which also might be a reason for updating it. They might be hard to follow.
- In particular the explanations about Class Commands seems difficult.
- Merging conceptual explanation and diagram notation explanation might be something to do.
- The term Target Class might be split up in two definitions.
-----
- The split up into a conceptual explanation and then separately an article for the diagram notation, might have been easy for writing the docs, but could be merged into a single article again for readability.
-----
- The readability of these articles might be questioned. See 'Redo Easy Themes' in the document Encircle Language Spec Strategy.
