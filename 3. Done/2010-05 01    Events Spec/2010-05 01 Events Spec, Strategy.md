Circle Language Spec Plan | Events Spec | 2010-05 | Strategy
===========================================================


Background
-----------

I had an idea about the basic diagram notation for Events since 2002, but an idea about an acceptable notation for drawing out a multicast event popped into my head now in 2010. Then after having studied and updated document templates for 6 ½ hours, I decided to reward myself with doing another *New Computer Language Functional Design* project: *Events*.


Parent Project
--------------
New Computer Language Functional Design


Character of the Work
---------------------

Working out a chapter of documentation.


Goal
----
The goal of this project is to work out the *Events* articles.


Strategy
---------

The strategy mostly was: *improvise*.

But lessons learned from the previous project were kept in mind:

\- Pick the easiest topic

\- Make a topic list out of existing rough texts, starting over,
and then using the existing text as a cross out


Before
------

Before the project the material was quite limited:

\- there were just a couple of pages of loose ideas,

\- loose texts coming out of a ± 2005 design of the code generator version,

\- loose material coming out of a ± 2003 design of the diagram notation.


After
-----

After the project the *Events* concept was fully worked out including the diagram notation.


Time Planning
-------------

No particular time planning was adopted.
