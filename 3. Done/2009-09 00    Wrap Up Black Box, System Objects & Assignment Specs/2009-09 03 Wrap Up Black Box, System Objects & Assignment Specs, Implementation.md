## **Purpose of This Document**
This document is a checklist for software development-related work, for a good approach and to not forget anything. It is not to be read over litterly. Later it serves as a reference for looking up how exactly something was done.
## **Approach**
The original idea was to first read over all the material, and then decide what to change about it.

But eventually the changes were made while reading it over. That seemed faster to do, and it was.
## **Checklist**
\- Analyse existing material / wrap up article groups:

\- Read over Parent Project description

\- Documentation

\- Leftover Ideas

\> Organize those first, before generating more.

\- System Objects documentation

\+ Set aside remaining ideas

\+ Isolate a version 3.0x of it

\- Assignment documentation

\- Integrate Assignment versions into the System Objects versions

\- Integrate Assignment XXXX-XX-XX XX into the list of versions

\- Then cross-out a copy of Assignment XXXX-XX-XX XX

\- Black Box documentation

\- Read over

\- Split up into parts

\- The unfinished side-issues and all will get an introduction about how unfinished they are.

\- Also sort out the existing articles, that came from other article groups.

\- Parameter articles
