## **Purpose of This Document**
This document is a checklist for software development-related work, for a good approach and to not forget anything. It is not to be read over litterly. Later it serves as a reference for looking up how exactly something was done.
## **Orientation Checklist**
\- Create a new project out of it and start planning.

\- Do not hold on too much to original step plannings and project-related brainstorms. Make an entirely new plan.

\- Setup project folders

\- Estimate how long you will be working on the orientation phase.

\> Not long. Analysing existing material will be long, but that will be moved to the research phase.

\- Determine goal 

\- Describe goal

\- Also fill in the other headings in *Software Development Goal* document.

\- Determine program elements (in the document *Software Development Elements & Time Estimation*)

Intermediate planning:

\- Now you can say how much time the *research phase* is going to cost.

\> A little more than usual, because existing material is read over in its entirety and a plan will be based on the research.

\- You can also give a rough estimation of the time-cost of the *whole project* based on the program elements.

\- I *am* going to do full score point estimation, even though I have not analysed all the existing material in detail.

\- Make a rough time estimation, based on the elements of the project (in the document *Software Development Elements & Time Estimation*).
You can really only make a good estimation of the time-cost after the research phase, but the research phase may take too long to deliver a time-cost estimation only after that.

\- The initial planning is made, but the plan will already be changed. Some things will be postponed indefinitely.

\- The current goal description and planning will be isolated into a version, and then the low-priority stuff will be left out of the planning.

\- Make the second (initial) plan. Isolate a version of that. You are going to adapt the plan again during the research phase.

\- Brainstorm about solutions
