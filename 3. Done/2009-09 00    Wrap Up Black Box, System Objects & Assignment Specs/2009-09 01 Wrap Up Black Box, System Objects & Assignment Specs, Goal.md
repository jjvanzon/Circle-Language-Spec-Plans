Purpose of this Document
------------------------

This document describes a goal and the approach of the project *Wrap Up Black Box, System Objects & Assignment*.


Parent Project
---------------

*New Computer Language Functional Design*

(Most objectives are explained inside the documentation of the parent project.)


Background
-----------

The current and previous projects are about producing the Black Box articles and redoing the System Objects and Assignment articles.

In the previous project on multiple occasions it was not clear how much work it was still going to be. The project on multiple occasions relied on a creative process only after which would be clear how much work was left to do.

This resulted in massive scope creep, because the scope only became apparent during the project. The plan made at the beginning of the project was of no use anymore. Then the work was done without any planning at all and it became an endless story.

That is why after 2½ months the project was discontinued and wrapped up.

By now it is clear where exactly things are going and what exactly to produce.

The work left to do will be turned into a new project with a more exact definition of what will be done, with a proper planning and without any loose ends.


Character of the Work
---------------------

Wrap up existing documentation


Goal
----

Finish up the *Black Box* documentation, *System Objects* documentation and *Assignment* documentation.


Products
--------

\- Black Box articles  version  2009-09-28 00  1.0

\- System Objects articles  version  2009-09-17 XX  3.0x

\- Assignment articles

(integrated into the System Objects articles)


Limitations
-----------

The idea in this project was to evaluate is something is really necessary and to be pragmatic when it comes to postponing stuff. It was important to consider whether work was more important than Microsoft certification. Eventually the material was not finished up, but only wrapped up to not leave behind a complete junkyard. This all because it is becoming so important to start working on Microsoft certification very soon. Most of the work initially planned was not done at all.


Tools & Techniques
------------------

Replanning was done frequently. So multiple versions of the goal description and elements & time planning exist.
