# There is an error after the process:

# Rewrite d33f9f7ca8274520b20d1a4dd87590fd417c5752 (653/653) (1524 seconds passed, remaining 0 predicted)
# Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten
# Could not rewrite refs/heads/master

# I tried checking out an old commit. 
# Gave me Permission denied errors for most (backup) copies Circle Docs Migration.
# The original Software System Docs repository does not give me that error.
# This may indicate that something went wrong with security in the first step of the migration.
# Hyp: Git Bash causes security issue.
# Exp: Updating git tools to latest version. Then try first migration step again.

# --------------------

# Retrying the process

# Newer git software gives me a warning, indicating to use the filter-repo command instead of filter-branch.

# Trying the first command using filter-repo instead of filter-branch

# git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf "4. Applications & Media"' --prune-empty HEAD --all

git filter-repo --invert-paths --path "4. Applications & Media"

# I seem to be redirected in circles trying to get it installed.
# I may just use filter-branch. At least I know how it works.
