Circle Language Spec Plan | Diagram Notation Spec | 2008-05 | Project Summary
============================================================================


Super-Project
-------------

*Circle Language Spec*

(This project was originally intermixed with the sub-project *Clarify Automatic Execution Order 2008-05*, but then the scope was split in two.)


Goal
----

There was some frustration, because it was unclear, what the diagram notation was going to be like. The goal of the project was to get a clear view on that. A clean up of the diagram notation content.


Limitation
----------

A limitation was, to only get the rules clear, not necessarily finish all the documentation.
