## **Purpose of this Document**
This document lists out the projects done in a period of time between 2009-06 and 2010-05.
## **Sub-Projects**
2009-06 - Black Box + Planning 

2009-08 - Review by Brother 

2009-09 - Redo System Objects 

2009-09 - Redo Assignment 

2010-02 - Interfaces 

2010-05 - Events

2010-05 - Inheritance

What is nice to realize is that one ‘hard topic’ was actually more easily worked out than expected:

\- Reliability of interfaces in bi-directional relationships

This was considered a difficult topic, and adequately solved during the Interfaces project.

So perhaps first trying to focus on the 'easier' topics, might give the hard topics time to settle and by the time you get to them, the idea may be clearer.
