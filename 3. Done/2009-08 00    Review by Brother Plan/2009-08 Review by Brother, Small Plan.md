Circle Language Spec Plan | Review by Brother | 2009-08 | Small Plan
====================================================================


Parent Project
--------------

*Circle Language Spec*


Goal
----

Goals I have with letting my brother review the material are:

- Check accessibility of material
- Get an opinion about the material

*The review used to have notes about topics not in scope of the Circle Language Spec. Notes about that were moved to another document.*


What Do I Expect?
-----------------

I expect it to not be so accessible right now, though. A lot is just under construction and might needs a redo.

I also expect it to be too much to just look into for a couple of hours, even to flip through the folders here and there.


General Planning
----------------

- Preparation:
    - Make small plan
    - Review it yourself
    - What do I expect?
    - Determine how to present things.
    - Make main project descriptions more concise.
        - \> Also integrate the Microsoft Certification and getting a new job everywhere within the main project descriptions.

- Presentation:
    - First say this:
        - Some stuff is still under construction,  
        but most of it is accessible and finished  
        It is all sort of a secret. Do not go off to companies, or put details about it on the internet.  
        ‘Code name’ for the new computer language is ‘the new computer language’.  
        The eventual names I have in mind are: Circle for the new computer language.
    - Let my brother discover the material for himself,  
      to check if the material is easily accessible.
    - But soon start showing him the main projects and the main products.
    - Specific things to show:
        - Project plans: __(4)__
            - Circle Language Spec, Project Steps & Time Planning
            - Circle Language Spec, Goal & Approach
        - Documentation: __(2)__
            - Code
                - Basic Diagram Elements
                - Coding Concepts
        - Software: __(9)__
            - \> Explaining the existing *software* is *much* harder.

- / ~~Don’t do:~~
    - ~~Maybe make a backup~~
        - \> Don’t do that.
        - \> Word always asks to save changes even if you have not changed anything, so just in case make everything read-only.
    - ~~Maybe a video recording tool~~
    - ~~Get as much as possible in shape for review?~~


Reflection
-----------

We covered the project plans, the documentation, but not the software.  
The documentation seemed clear and well organized.  
It seemed easy to pick up by someone like my brother, who is a smart guy.  
The version folders were immediately clear.

Also the planning was completely discussed.

We did not cover the documentation of the new computer language literally.  
We covered several coding concepts through a discussion about the language.  
The following concepts were covered:

- Basic Diagram Elements
- Objects
- Classes
- Interfaces
- Black Boxing
- Connectors & Connections
- Access Marks
- Execution Control
- Commands
- Parameters
- Module
- Lists
- Values

It surprised me, we got to cover so much. What you can see, is that the topics that automatically seem to get attention when you introduce someone to the language through discussion, are the topics that are either completely worked out on paper, or completely clear in my head. That is good. That means that the most important things seem worked out well enough.

Reflection on the goals:

- Check accessibility of material
- Get an opinion about the material

The material was received to be *quite* accessible. Phew.  
I did not get a real opinion about it from my brother, but I might get one in the future.

Next to it being fun to be discussing the diagram notation, there were also a couple of tips he had:

- Do not call it 'Legacy'. It could come off belittling. Find a better name for it.
- Integration layer: can be interpreted as integration within the system. It is about 'outward' integration. Possibly find another term for it.
- The first diagram in Basic Diagram Elements might be ineffective in my brother's opinion. 'It could be an elephant.' Find a more concrete example. Something that is something for real.
- 'Analogy to the real world' was unnecessary according to my brother.
