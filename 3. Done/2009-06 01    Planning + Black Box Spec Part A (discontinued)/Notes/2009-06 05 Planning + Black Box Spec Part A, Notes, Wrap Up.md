## **Purpose of This Document**
This document is a checklist for software development-related work, for a good approach and to not forget anything. It is not to be read over literally. Later it serves as a reference for looking up how exactly something was done.
## **Standard Issues**
\- Evaluation by software developer:

\> A template is available for this: *Software Development Reflection Template.doc*.

\- About time planning

\- About progress monitoring

\- About working methods

\- About technical solution

\- About functionality

\- An overview for presentation purposes
Something you can show off in a portfolio.

\- In every reflection, the following questions need to be answered:

\- What went well?

\- What could be done better?

\- What went wrong?

\- How should we do it next time?

\- Wrap up plan (TO DO, is continuously changed.)

\- Tidy up software development project plan documents

\- Make entry in project list tidy

\- Put leftover TO DO items in a project document *Postponed* or *Improvements*.

Investigate if the current functionality is adequate and possibly define a *new* programming trajectory.

↑ Possibly a next programming trajectory (or save it for a later project.)
(Start over the whole trajectory. See it as a new project.)
## **Custom Plan**
\- Make evaluation document

\- Postpone everything left to do.

\- Wrap up the plans of this project and call it off / discontinue it.

\- Wrap up step-by-step documents

\- Change project description documents

\- Detail:

\- Call the project 'Planning + Black Box A'.

\- Finish evaluation document

\- Detail:

\- Documents seem to contain the term ‘versie’.

\- Make page headers of project documents bigger
