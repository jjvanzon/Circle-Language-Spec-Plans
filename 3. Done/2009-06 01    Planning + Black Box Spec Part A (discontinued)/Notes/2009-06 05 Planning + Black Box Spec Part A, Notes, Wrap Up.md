Purpose of This Document
------------------------

This document is a checklist for software development-related work, for a good approach and to not forget anything. It is not to be read over literally. Later it serves as a reference for looking up how exactly something was done.


Standard Issues
---------------

- [x] Evaluation by software developer:
    - [x] \> A template is available for this: *Software Development Reflection Template.doc*.
    - [x] About time planning
    - [x] About progress monitoring
    - [x] About working methods
    - [x] About technical solution
    - [x] About functionality
    - [x] An overview for presentation purposes.  
      Something you can show off in a portfolio.

- [x] In every reflection, the following questions need to be answered:
    - [x] What went well?
    - [x] What could be done better?
    - [x] What went wrong?
    - [x] How should we do it next time?

- [x] Wrap up plan (TO DO, is continuously changed.)
    - [x] Tidy up software development project plan documents
    - [x] Make entry in project list tidy
    - [x] Put leftover TO DO items in a project document *Postponed* or *Improvements*.

Investigate if the current functionality is adequate and possibly define a *new* programming trajectory.

↑ Possibly a next programming trajectory (or save it for a later project.)
(Start over the whole trajectory. See it as a new project.)
