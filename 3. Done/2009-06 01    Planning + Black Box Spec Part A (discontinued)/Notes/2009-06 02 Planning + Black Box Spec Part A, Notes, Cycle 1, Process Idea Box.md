## **Purpose of This Document**
This document is a checklist for software development-related work, for a good approach and to not forget anything. It is not to be read over litterly. Later it serves as a reference for looking up how exactly something was done.
## **Custom Plan**
\- Process idea box

\- Gather ideas

\> Check, that you really do not have any other places where you drop ideas into, apart from the idea box…

\> Indeed I do not.

\- Categorize ideas

\- Additional categorization

\- Some categories are sort of vague

\- Creator 0.9

\- Exclusion: Inheritance / Black Box / Access Control

\- Uncategorized

\- Working Methods / Templates etc.

\- Working Methods / Projects

\- Drop ideas into the documentation

\- Most go into system documentation

\- Put ideas about projects in the main projects document
New Computer Language Functional Design.

\- Look inside general documents to find ideas specific to the current project.

\> None there
## **Leftover Issues**
\- I think I forgot to update the Contents section of the Software System introduction document after I added Object Algebra to it.

\- Core got another section: Execution. It needs to be documented inside the redirection page of Core.

\- Another one: Code \ Naming
