Planning + Black Box Spec Part A

Initial Plan

Goal Description***
================================


*Author: JJ van Zon*

*Location: Oosterhout, The Netherlands*

*Date: June 24, 2009 – September 10, 2009*

## **Remark**
This is the initial plan. The plan changed during the project. You will find the changed plan in a different document. But the initial plan still matters for overview of the project.
## **Parent Project**
*New Computer Language Functional Design*

(Most objectives are explained inside the documentation of the parent project.)
## **Character of the work**
Documentation / functional design
## **Goal**
\- Plan complete remains of *New Computer Language Functional Design*

\- Functionally work out the *Black Box* concept.
## **Side-goals**
\- Process Idea Box
## **Limitations**
\- Do not update project plan templates. Make dues with the way they are now.

\- When processing the idea box, the first 29 ½ pages are old ideas. Do not look at them.
## **Approach**
This is the approach for working out the *Black Box* concept.

Look over the existing material there is now.

Work out the idea as you go along.

Make concise documentation.

Consider the ‘writing efficiently’ rules in the project documentation of *New Computer Language Functional Design*.
## **Benefits**
This is one of the easiest topics left. The benefits of working out an easy topic is that the easy topics are most overdue, fastest to make, and because they are clear in your head they will also be clearer on paper, so it will produce better quality of documentation.
## **Future**
After this project it is probably best to work on Microsoft certification first.

The following 8 months are planned ahead, so it is clear what is next for the future.

See parent project *New Computer Language Functional Design*.
## **Conditions**
You have to orient yourself into the idea box and the existing documentation in order to really know the extent of the work and to really go into details about the approach.
## **Time Planning**
A rough time planning of this 8 month period can be found in the project documentation of the super-project *New Computer Language Functional Design*.

This sub-project will have a small time-planning document.

It is estimated, that this project may take only **1 week** or **10 days** tops.
## **Particular Difficulty**
A difficult part of this project is working your way through a lot of existing ideas: the idea box is 60 pages, and the ideas in the unfinished Black Box documentation are 29 pages of loose ideas yet to be turned into good documentation. Most of that is out of the original Symbol documentation (the unfinished design of a diagram notation for program code from the year 2004). But it will probably serve only as a cross-out list. So they do not have to be carefully considered in advance.
