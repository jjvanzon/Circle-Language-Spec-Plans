Circle-Language-Spec-Plans
==========================

*JJ van Zon, 2021-02-17*

This repository would contain the plans, notes and TODO's about [Circle-Language-Spec](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec).

Circle would be an unfinished programming language. It aims to once become a diagram notation for visualizing computer code.

You may find the following sub-folders here:

- [Current](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec-Plans/tree/master/1.%20Current)
    - Things actively busy with.
- [Future](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec-Plans/tree/master/2.%20Future)
    - What might be done in the future.
- [Done](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec-Plans/tree/master/3.%20Done)
    - Notes about activities from the past.
- [Out of Scope](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec-Plans/tree/master/4.%20Out%20of%20Scope)
    - Notes about topics that did not make it into the spec. That could be things part of the [Broader View](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/tree/master/2.%20Broader%20View) sub-folder in the Circle-Language-Spec repository. Or notes about [Construct Drafts](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec/tree/master/3.%20Constructs%20Drafts). Even topics that might not be found at all in the Circle-Language-Spec repository (anymore) might be found here. The idea would be to eventually remove those.
- [Archive](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec-Plans/tree/master/5.%20Archive)
    - Content that might not be relevant anymore. It may be one step away from being deleted. It is still kept in this folder in case something would become relevant again.
