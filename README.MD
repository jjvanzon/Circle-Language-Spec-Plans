Circle-Language-Spec-Plans
==========================

*JJ van Zon, 2021-02-17*

This repository would contain the plans, notes and TODO's about Circle-Language-Spec.

Circle would be an unfinished programming language. It aims to once become a diagram notation for visualizing computer code.

You may find the following sub-folders here:

- Current

    - Notes about things actively busy with.

- Future

    - Notes about what might be done in the future.
     
- Done

    - Notes about activities from the past.

- Out of Scope

    - Notes about topics that did not make it into the spec (yet). That could be things part of the *Broader View* sub-folder in the Circle-Language-Spec repository. Or notes about the *Construct Drafts* that might also be found in the Circle-Language-Spec repository. Even topics that might not be found at all in the Circle-Language-Spec repository (anymore) might be found here. An idea is eventually removing those last topics.

- Archive

    - Content that might not be relevant anymore. It may be one step away from being deleted. But somehow it is still kept in this folder in case it may become relevant again.

Circle-Language-spec itself might be found here: [Circle-Language-Spec](https://github.com/jjvanzon/Circle-Language-Spec)
