Circle Language Spec Plan, Automatic Diagram Organization Ideas
=========================================
*JJ van Zon, The Netherlands, 2020-04*

Part of it could be documenting ideas about diagram metrics that are only in my head and ones derived from a prototype the of diagram drawing engine I made.

Topics are e.g.:

- Curved lines
- Bundling of lines

The need to display large amounts of items really comes to light now plus that something should be done about it.

Also the need for line bundling starts becoming more apparent.

Other topics:
* Inward references
* Access marks (when to show them, when not to show themâ€¦)
* Lines exiting the diagram
