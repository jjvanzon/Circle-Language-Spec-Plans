# Diagram Metrics Ideas

*JJ van Zon, The Netherlands, 2020-04*

This document contains some loose ideas about diagram metrics. Specifically excluding ideas about Automatic Containment, which may have gone a little side-tracked, because it's complex and has loose ends, and general diagram drawing out: you might not want that to be hindered by that.

Part of it could be documenting ideas about diagram metrics that are only in my head and ones derived from a prototype the of diagram drawing engine I made.

Topics are e.g.:

- Curved lines
- Bundling of lines

The need to display large amounts of items really comes to light now plus that something should be done about it.

Also the need for line bundling starts becoming more apparent.

Other topics:
* Inward references
* Access marks (when to show them, when not to show themâ€¦)
* Lines exiting the diagram
