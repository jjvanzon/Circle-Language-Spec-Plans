Circle Language Spec Plan, Relations Spec Update Ideas
===========================
*JJ van Zon, The Netherlands, 2020-04*

* Relation Direction
* Relations to Pointers

* Relations articles might need an update considering that the notation(s) for static might change things.
* Merge conceptual explanation and diagram notation.
* Change the notation for a bidirectional relation.
* Relations does not make sense anymore when related classes are not necessarly fixed by the class.

The split up into a conceptual explanation and then separately an article for the diagram notation, might have been easy for writing the docs, but could be merged into a single article again for readability.

The readability of these articles might be questioned. See 'Redo Easy Themes' in the document Circle Language Spec Strategy.
