Automatic Diagram Organization Spec Ideas
=========================================
*JJ van Zon, The Netherlands, 2020-04*

Part of it could be documenting ideas about diagram metrics that are only in my head and ones derived from a prototype the of diagram drawing engine I made.

An option to ignore fixed logical residence would be welcome.
In that case the fixed logical residence might only be pointed out with an empty reference to the imaginary residence. That way automatic containment will work, but publically-accessible classes are still available with just the namespace qualifier. (-> Lower Contents)

Elements of different assemblies seem to intermix too much and parts of one assembly are shown as an intrinsic part of the an assembly that uses it. Things might be better off as better visible as being externally defined.

It is a problem that everything is displayed as composite aggregation, because in some places it works completely counter-intuitive (where you would expect objects to be sibblings, but they are nested instead?).

The need to display large amounts of items really comes to light now plus that something should be done about it.

Also the need for line bundling starts becoming more apparent.

Diagram Expression Cross Out:
After documenting diagram expression might go through the old Symbol documentation as a cross out list, and delete everything already covered, and to see what topics remain.
