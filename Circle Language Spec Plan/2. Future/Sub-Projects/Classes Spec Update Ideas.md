Circle Language Spec Plan, Classes Spec Update Ideas
=========================
*JJ van Zon, The Netherlands, 2020-04*

* Classes articles might need an update considering that the notation(s) for static might change things.
* The readability of the Classes articles was questionable, which also might be a reason for updating it. They are quite hard to follow.
* In particular the explanations about Class Commands is difficult.
* Merge conceptual explanation and diagram notation explanation.
* The term Target Class may have to be split up in two definitions.

The split up into a conceptual explanation and then separately an article for the diagram notation, might have been easy for writing the docs, but could be merged into a single article again for readability.

The readability of these articles might be questioned. See 'Redo Easy Themes' in the document Circle Language Spec Strategy.
