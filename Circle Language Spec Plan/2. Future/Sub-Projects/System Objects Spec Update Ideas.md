System Objects Spec Update Ideas
================================
*JJ van Zon, The Netherlands, 2008*

The System Objects article group may need extensions in the future.
It would be revisited to make complete the set of system aspects and system commands and cross out remaining ideas and topics.

Somewhere I wrote down the idea that Getters & Setters should be a sub-topic inside System Objects, but I am not sure why. It seems that is already coverted by the content?
