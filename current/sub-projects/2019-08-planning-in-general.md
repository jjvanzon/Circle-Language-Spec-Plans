### Done

#### 2020-05-27 Done Brainstorm Priorities

- [x] I am not sure how to approach things right now.
- [x] ~~I could also try and pick a design issue from the list 'Language Design / Content Changes' above.~~
- [x] ~~I feel somehow I had more plans, but I forgot about them.~~
- [x] ~~Maybe there are few main problems I would like to highlight.~~
- [x] ~~Somehow I tend to want to just start at the top and start reformulating.~~
- [x] I guess I am not sure where to start.
- [x] And I am also still a little surprised that I am at this stage. I feel I must have forgotten something that must be left to do, before I can do this.
- [x] ~~I think maybe heavy redesign is off the table for now, because I estimate that would be too intense for now.~~
- [x] I also have in mind marking work as postponed for 'Encircle Broader View' and 'Encircle Construct Drafts', cleaning up the brainstorms that covert those + Encircle Language Spec. That way I might create overview over the TODO notes.
- [x] The feeling I forgot something, feels like it could be in the texts below, but the texts below seem to be too rough and unstructured to give me that insight and overview. If it were more structured and overviewable, and done stuff marked as done, postponed stuff marked as such and split into coherent chunks. I think I would like that.
- [x] So structure the TODO and Postponed things about Encircle Language Spec Revamp notes, might be what I want to do first.

#### 2019-08-05 Done Writing Style Mixed Issues

- [x] ~~The work might be modularized. I am not attracted to how CSS3 is modularized, each piece of specs with a different state of being finished up. It seems messy. But I can employ the same organization to accept certain concepts are just more crystalized out than others, making it easier to share, even in an unfinished state, and stimulating keeping things separated and separately usable even when other parts are just really still messy. > Scoped things more sharply instead, so more is finished up better percentually.~~
- [x] ~~I took a look at some of the postponed work. I worry about the messiness of the content. And if the loose ends will make the idea fall apart. And whether this makes it even fit for publishing. I just don't know. But I think I should come back to it later. Because I had strategies for this. And I might be too hard on myself. A clear 'flag' [Preliminary documentation] in red somewhere at the top usually does the trick. Might tell people clearly not to expect too much from the text that follows. Just being clear about that might be enough.~~

#### 2020-05-24 Done Notes Planning

- [x] Maybe merge more article together in the first chapters.
- [x] Maybe list out main language design issues.
- [x] ~~Some work in Future Sub-Projects may already be done.~~
    - [x] ~~> Applies to the TODO item 'Merge conceptual explanation with diagram explanation'. Those 2 things may now be put into the same article, but the explanations are still often 2 explanations instead of one. So I do not think I can call it done.~~

#### 2020-05-10 Done Brainstorm Effort

It may not be within my capacity to do some of the things I plan to do. Thinking critically about word usage and whether I am stating things too strictly... I feel this might not correspond with my energy budget. I made a careful conclusion about that before. Publishing might be more important, than if I might come off too strongly in the text. It feels like this effort is pulling me down more than I might be able to handle. It seems to be weighing on me.

Perhaps I can drop the goal of trying to use a different language style. My next goal was scoping. I seem to still be bargaining with the idea, like: "Maybe I can just reformulate when it *really* seems to harsh." I think maybe that won't work. Because I tend to evaluate the harshness, and this evaluation is 'jittery': sometimes it seems to be 'on', sometimes 'off', sometimes too on tightly, sometimes maybe too weakly. Perhaps I am better off dropping the whole goal of rewording it. I like learning to use language with more air in it, for my personal life for communication to others, or to prevent holding on too tightly to an idea. But this hobby project may need some air in it. Paradoxically, by not loosening up the language. I feel that writing new texts, I already seem to adopt a ligher way of conveying ideas. Evaluating existing texts seems harder.

I think I lean towards the decision of dropping the goal of reformulating texts to be more 'open'. I still have to get used to the idea.

Little reformulations here and there is something I do when reading over and editing my own texts. Some wording changes I might want to be tolerant towards. But the anxiousness might be something I want to let go of.

I feel like I recognize a personality in my own texts, that I adopted to hopefully be taken more seriously. I feel I am on a different wavelength now, or that I want to be.

So with that new perspective on the work, I was done and satisfied with the last page of the text I was working on within like a minute. Perhaps now I can focus more on what I actually chose to do: scope the project some more.

#### 2020-05-08 Done Brainstorm Priorities

- [x] Rewording the Done projects is getting a bit boring.
- [x] ~~Maybe wrap up Parameters planning doc.~~
- [x] Scoping was an alternative thing to focus on.
- [x] ~~Something else could be actually digging into the Encircle Language Spec docs themselves.~~
- [x] I think scoping is a better choice for now.
- [x] I want to go over the Encircle Language Spec Plan documents, moving things out of scope off the top of my head.
- [x] Side-goal: I read nicer docs, giving my head a bit of a break.
- [x] I think I will mark things with red before actually moving content out.
- [x] Still lots of definites in the wording of the main planning docs.
- [x] I do like too see it reworded it to nothing being a strict rule anymore and you can always make up your own mind. It seems this does not harm the integrity of the idea.

#### 2020-03-15 Done Planning

I read over notes to know where I was, and mark some things of as 'done'.

This was too intense. I wonder if starting to change documentation will be too intense too or if I should stop now. Or if other activities or non-activities will be even more intense. I choose to stop for a while now. After a little over 20 minutes.
