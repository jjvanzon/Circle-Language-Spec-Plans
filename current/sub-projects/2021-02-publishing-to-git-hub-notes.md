### Done

#### 2019-08-05 Done Open Source Brainstorm

- [x] How do you even license documentation?
    - [x] I wanted to throw an MIT license against it, but that is for code... hmm...
    - [x] Here is some information: <https://dreamsongs.com/IHE/IHE-50.html> 
    - [x] This might be something: FreeBSD Documentation License
    - [x] It basically seems an MIT license, but then for documentation.
- [x] ~~Is it really such a good plan to open source it? Am I really not just throwing away money? Maybe it is better to wait with that decision, after I know where things are heading with work and income? > Think I will do it anyway.~~
- [x] There is an '... IPC Parse.doc' text in the source control history. It should be deleted. I guess I have to search for intellectual property problems. This in docs that are so intellectual property sensitive. Before open sourcing it, you need to do this intellectual property check.
- [x] 2004-00-00 XX    Symbol Language\Symbol Pictures (Keep Packed, Paths Too Long).zip has intellectual property problems in Pictures\Diagram Examples.
- [x] ~~Is the summary of the C and C++ in Summaries of Other Languages an intellectual property problem? I summarized the languages using MSDN as source information. Hmm... If I didn't mention the source information it would not look like an intellectual property problem. Just I read stuff about a programming language and wrote stuff down... not sure. > It think this is an unreasonable doubt.~~
- [x] "Relational Structure"
    - [x] Might mention a relationship example which might not be kept in there. It also may reference a company name.
    - [x] I think I would be better off removing that document from the Encircle-Language-Spec repository.
- [x] Renaming Encircle-Language-Spec-Plan to Encircle-Language-Spec-Plans (plural).
- [x] Reorganizing Broader View and Construct Drafts knowing they would also be published?

#### 2021-02-09 Done Publishing

- [x] Readme's?
- [x] Just publishing it?
- [x] Durable links:
    - [x] Renumbering the sections, the URL's might not stay constant. A not-numbered file name and an index/contents page with links might be an alternative.
- [x] Replacing swear words
- [x] The name "Circle" is used by a similar product. Should I rename? And to what?
    - [x] "Encircle"
    - [x] ~~Considered alternatives: "Symbol" / "JJ's Computer Language" / "JJ's Visual Language" / "This Computer Language".~~
    - [x] In main repo:
        - [x] Replacing "Circle" with "Encircle" in content
        - [x] Replacing "circle" with "encircle" in doc file names (and links to them)
        - [X] Correcting heading layout
        - [x] Replacing "Encircle 3" and with "Circle 3"
        - [x] Double-checking occurrences of "Encircle"
        - [x] Correcting articles ("a" / "an"): Correcting "a Encircle" to "an Encircle" (and "a *Encircle*" as well)
    - [x] In planning docs repo:
        - [x] Replacing "Circle" with "Encircle" in content
        - [x] Replacing "circle" with "encircle" in doc file names
        - [x] Correcting heading layout
        - [x] Correcting articles ("a" / "an"): Correcting "a Encircle" to "an Encircle" (and "a *Encircle*" as well)
        - [x] ~ Double-checking occurrences of "Encircle"
    - [x] Renaming the repo's
    - [x] Merging changes

#### 2021-02-08 Done Publishing: My Brother's First Name

- [x] Is in some sub-project planning doc.
- [x] I can take it out of the current version.
- [x] Should I ask him if he is OK with it staying in the source control history or if he wants it out of there?
- [x] Also in "2009-06 01 Encircle Language Spec Plan Part B, Sub-Projects" his first name is mentioned.
- [x] I may be better off removing some items of history from Encircle-Language-Spec-Plan completely for this purpose.
- [x] There is also a split up between a doc for 'in-scope' and one for 'out-of-scope'.
- [x] It is even in this document. This is really difficult to unravel. I think I can't without harming the integrity of the change history.
- [x] I think I am better off asking my brother. If there was an easy option to take it out without harming the change history...
- [x] > Waiting on brother's response. > He's fine with it.
